<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>MARSHALL SENDS FOR RICKARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE large round clock was striking nine as “Casey”
Rickard’s dancing step carried him into the outer
office of Tod Marshall. The ushering clerk, coatless and
vestless in expectation of the third, hot spring day, made
a critical appraisement of the engineer’s get-up before he
spoke. Then he stated that Mr. Marshall had not yet
come.</p>

<p>For a London tie and a white silk shirt belted into
white serge trousers were smart for Tucson. The clerks
in the employ of the Overland Pacific and of the Sonora
and Yaqui Railroads had stared at Rickard as he entered;
they followed his progress through the room. He
was a newcomer in Tucson. He had not yet acquired
the apathetic habits of its citizens. He wore belts, instead
of suspenders. His white trousers, duck or serge,
carried a newly pressed crease each morning.</p>

<p>The office had not reached a verdict on the subject of
K. C. Rickard. The shirt-sleeved, collarless clerks would
have been quick to dub him a dandy were it not for a
page of his history that was puzzling them. He had
held a chair of engineering in some eastern city. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
had resigned, the wind-tossed page said, to go on the
road as a fireman. His rapid promotion had been spectacular;
the last move, a few weeks ago, to fill an office
position in Tucson. The summons had found him on
the west coast of Mexico, where the Overland Pacific
was pushing its tracks.</p>

<p>“You can wait here,” suggested the clerk, looking
covertly at the shoes of the man who a few years before
had been shoveling coal on a Wyoming engine. “Mr.
Marshall said to wait.”</p>

<p>“Ribbons, instead of shoe-laces!” carped the human
machine that must ever write letters which other men
sign. “And a blue pin to match his tie! I call that going
some!”</p>

<p>It would never have occurred to Rickard, had he
thought about it at all that morning as he knotted his
tie of dark, brilliant blue silk, that the selection of his
lapis pin was a choice; it was an inevitable result, an
instinctive discretion of his fingers. It warped, however,
the suspended judgment of Marshall’s men who
had never seen him shoveling coal, disfigured by a denim
jumper. They did not know that they themselves were
slovens; ruined by the climate that dulls vanity and wilts
collars.</p>

<p>“Give him a year to change some of his fine habits!”
wagered Smythe, the stoop-shouldered clerk, as the door
of the inner office closed.</p>

<p>“To change his habits less!” amended the office wit.
And then they fell to speculating what Marshall was
going to do with him. What pawn was he in the game
that every one in Tucson followed with eager self-interested
concern? Marshall’s was the controlling hand in
Arizona politics; the maker of governors, the arbiter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of big corporations; president of a half-dozen railroads.
Not a move of his on the board that escaped notice.</p>

<p>On the other side of the door, Rickard was echoing
the office question. This play job, where did it lead to?
He had liked his work, under Stratton. There had
been some pretty problems to meet—what did Marshall
mean to do with him?</p>

<p>The note had set the appointment for nine. Rickard
glanced at his watch, and took out his <i>Engineering Review</i>.
It would be ten before that door opened on Tod
Marshall!</p>

<p>He knew that, on the road, Marshall’s work began
at dawn. “A man won’t break from overwork, or rust
from underwork, if he follows the example of the sun,”
Rickard had often heard him expound his favorite
theory. “It is only the players, the sybarites, who can
afford to pervert the arrangement nature intended for
us.” But in Tucson, controlled by the wifely solicitude
of his Claudia, he was coerced into a regular perversion.
His office never saw him until the morning was half
gone.</p>

<p>A half-hour later, Rickard finished reading a report
on the diversion of a great western river. The name of
Thomas Hardin had sent him off on a tangent of memory.
The Thomas Hardin whose efforts to bring water
to the desert of the Colorado had been so spectacularly
unsuccessful <i>was</i> the Tom Hardin he had known! The
sister had told him so, the girl with the odd bronze eyes;
opal matrix they were, with glints of gold, or was it
green? She herself was as unlike the raw boor of his
memory as a mountain lily is like the coarse rock of its
background. Even a half-sister to Hardin, as Marshall,
their host at dinner the week before, had explained it,—no,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
even that did not explain it. That any of the Hardin
blood should be shared by the veins of that girl, why it
was incredible! The name “Hardin” suggested crudity,
loud-mouthed bragging; conceit. He could understand
the failure of the river project since the sister had assured
him that it was the same Tom Hardin who had
gone to college at Lawrence; had married Gerty Holmes.
Queer business, life, that he should cross, even so remotely,
their orbits again. That was a chapter he liked
to skip.</p>

<p>He walked over to the windows, shielded by bright
awnings, and looked down on the city where the next
few years of his life might be caught. Comforting to
reflect that an engineer is like a soldier, never can be
certain about to-morrow. Time enough to know that
to-morrow meant Tucson! What was that threadbare
proverb in the Overland Pacific that Tod Marshall always
keeps his men until they lose their teeth? That defined
the men who made themselves necessary!</p>

<p>His eyes were resting on the banalities of the modern
city that had robbed “old town” of its flavor. Were
it not for the beauty of the distant hills, the jar and
rumble of the trains whose roar called to near-by pleasure
cities, twinkling lights and crowded theaters, stretches of
parks and recreation grounds, he, who loved the thrill and
confinement of an engine, who had found enticement in
a desert, a chapter of adventure in the barrancas of Mexico,
would stifle in Tucson! American progress was as
yet too thin a veneer on Mexican indifference to make
the place endurable; as a city. Were it a village of ten
thousand people, then he’d not be scolding at his hotel,
The Rosales. He could find the limitations picturesque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
even. The census it was that accused those dusty unswept
floors, the stained cuspidors, the careless linen, and
The Rosales the best place in town! One has a right
to expect comforts in a city.</p>

<p>“I’m good for a lifetime here, if I want it,” his thoughts
would work back to the starting place. “If I knuckle
down to it, let him grow to depend on me, it’s as good
as settled that I am buried in Tucson!” Hadn’t he heard
Marshall himself say that he “didn’t keep a kindergarten—that
his office wasn’t a training-school for men!” He
wanted his men to stay! That, one of the reasons of the
great man’s power; detail rested on the shoulders of his
employees. It kept his own brain clear, receptive to big
achievements.</p>

<p>“Perhaps as the work unrolls, as I see more of what he
wants of me, why he wants me, I may like it, I may get
to shout for Tucson!” It was improbable enough to smile
over! Child’s work, compared to Mexico. He was never
tired—that was his grievance; he had it, now; he was
never tired.</p>

<p>The distinction of serving Marshall well certainly had
its drawbacks. He wanted to sweep on. Whether he had
a definite terminal, a concrete goal, had he ever stopped
to think? Specialization had always a fascination for him.
It was that which had thrown him out of his instructorship
into the fire-box of a western engine. It had governed
his course at college—to know one thing well, and
then to prove that he knew it well! Contented in the
Mexican barrancas, here he was chafing, restive, after a
few weeks of Tucson. For what was he getting here?
Adding what scrap of experience to the rounding of his
profession?</p>

<p>Retrospectively, engineering could hardly be said to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the work of his choice. Rather had it appeared to choose
him. From boyhood engineers had always been, to him,
the soldiers of modern civilization. To conquer and
subdue mountains, to shackle wild rivers, to suspend trestles
over dizzy heights, to throw the tracks of an advancing
civilization along a newly blazed trail, there would
always be a thrill in it for him. It had changed the best
quarter-back of his high school into the primmest of students
at college. Only for a short time had he let his
vanity side-track him, when the honor of teaching what
he had learned stopped his own progress. A rut—! He
remembered the day when it had burst on him, the realization
of the rut he was in. He could see his Lawrence
schoolroom, could see yet the face under the red-haired
mop belonging to Jerry Matson—queer he remembered
the name after all those years! He could picture the look
of consternation when he threw down his book, and announced
his desertion.</p>

<p>“Casey was off his feed,” he had heard one of the students
say as he passed a buzzing group in the hall. “He
looks peaked.”</p>

<p>He had handed in his resignation the next day. A
month later, and he was shoveling coal on the steep
grades of Wyoming.</p>

<p>“Marshall keeps his men with him!” The engineer’s
glance traveled around the fleckless office. A stranger to
Marshall would get a wrong idea of the man who worked
in it! Those precise files, the desk, orderly and polished,
the gleaming linoleum—and then the man who made the
negro janitor’s life a proud burden! His clothes always
crumpled—spots, too, unless his Claudia had had a chance
at them! Black string tie askew, all the outward visible
signs of the southern gentleman of assured ancestry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Not even a valet would ever keep Tod Marshall up to the
standard of that office. What did he have servants for,
he had demanded of Rickard, if it were not to jump after
him, picking up the loose ends he dropped?</p>

<p>Curious thing, magnetism. That man’s step on the
stair, and every man-jack of them would jump to attention,
from Ben, the colored janitor, who would not swap
his post for a sinecure so long as Tod Marshall’s one lung
kept him in Arizona, to Smythe, the stoop-shouldered
clerk, who had followed Marshall’s cough from San Francisco.
Poor Smythe! as inextricably entangled in the
meshes of red tape as was the hapless Lady of Shalott in
the web of her own snarled loom. It was said in Arizona—he
himself had met the statement in Tucson—that any
man who had ever worked for Tod Marshall would rather
be warmed by the reflection of his greatness than be given
posts of personal distinction.</p>

<p>Rickard found his office the only attractive place in the
desert city. Shining and airy, even in the hottest days,
its gaily screened windows were far enough above the
street to give a charitable perspective. Restive as he was
under the inaction of the last few weeks, he could acknowledge
a quaintness of foreign suggestion in the mixture
of Indian and Mexican influence, hampered, rather
than helped, by American aggressiveness. Over the heads
of a group of low buildings he could see the roof of the
old mission church, now the lounging place for roisterers
and sponges. There, the fiery mescal, the terrible tequila,
were sending many a white lad to destruction.</p>

<p>Those office buildings across the street, gay with canvas,
suggested American enterprise. In the distance were
the substantial structures of the lusty western university.
Down by the track the new home of the Overland Pacific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
was nearing completion. In the street below, young
girls with their crisp duck skirts and colored waists gave
the touch of blossoming. Mexican women wrapped in
the inevitable black shawl were jostling one another’s
baskets. The scene was full of color and charm, but to
the watcher who was eager to be on and doing, it cried
teasingly of inertia.</p>

<p>Was it office routine Marshall intended him for? He
admired without stint Tod Marshall, but he preferred to
work by the side of the other kind, the strong men, without
physical handicap, the men who take risks, the men
who live the life of soldiers. That was the life he
wanted. He would wait long enough to get Marshall’s
intention, and then, if it meant—this! he would break
loose. He would go back to the front where he belonged;
back to the firing-line.</p>

<p>As the hands of the round clock in the outer office
were pointing to ten, the door opened and Marshall entered.
His clothes, of indefinite blackish hue, would have
disgraced an eastern man. His string tie had a starboard
list, and his hat was ready for a rummage sale.
But few would have looked at his clothes. The latent
energy of the dynamic spirit that would frequently turn
that quiet office into a maelstrom gleamed in those Indian-black
eyes. Beneath the shabby cloth, one suspected
the daily polished skin; under the old slouch hat was
the mouth of purpose, the lips that no woman, even his
Claudia, had kissed without the thrill of fear.</p>

<p>Marshall glanced back at the clock, and then toward
his visitor.</p>

<p>“On time!” he observed.</p>

<p>Rickard, smiling, put his book in his pocket.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MARSHALL threw his hat on a chair, the morning
paper on his desk. He aimed his burned-out cigar
at the nearest cuspidor, but it fell foul, the ashes scattering
over Sam’s lately scoured linoleum. Instantly there
was appearance of settled disorder. Marshall emptied
his pockets of loose papers, spreading them out on his
flat-top desk.</p>

<p>“Sit down!”</p>

<p>Rickard took the chair at the other side of the desk.</p>

<p>Marshall rang a bell. Instantly the shirt-sleeved clerk
entered.</p>

<p>“I shall not see any one,” the chief announced. “I don’t
want to be interrupted. Take these to Smythe.”</p>

<p>His eyes followed the shutting of the door, then turned
square upon Rickard. “I need you. It’s a hell of a
mess!”</p>

<p>The engineer wanted to know what kind of a “mess”
it was.</p>

<p>“That river. It’s running away from them. It’s always
going to run away from them. I’m going to send you
down to stop it.”</p>

<p>“The Colorado!” exclaimed Rickard. It was no hose
to be turned, simply, off from a garden bed!</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve been following it? It’s one of the
biggest things that’s happened in this part of the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Too big for the men who have been trying to swing it.
You’ve followed it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Queer coincidence, reading that report just
now! “I’ve not been there. But the engineering papers
used to get to me in Mexico. I’ve read all the reports.”</p>

<p>His superior’s question was uncharacteristically superfluous.
Who had not read with thrilled nerves of that
wild river which men had been trying to put under work-harness?
Who, even among the stay-at-homes, had not
followed the newspaper stories of the failure to make a
meek servant and water-carrier of the Colorado, that
wild steed of mountain and desert? What engineer, no
matter how remote, would not “follow” that spectacular
struggle between men and Titans?</p>

<p>“Going to send me to Salton?” he inquired. The railroad
had been kept jumping to keep its feet dry. His
job to be by that inland sea which last year had been
desert!</p>

<p>“No. Brainerd is there. He can manage the tracks.
I am going to send you down to the break.”</p>

<p>Rickard did not answer. He felt the questioning eyes
of his chief.</p>

<p>“Down to the break,” repeated Tod Marshall, his
bright black eyes taking in every detail of the engineer’s
get-up, resting, finally, on his sunburned face. “Have
one?” He offered Rickard his choice of two small black
cigars.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no,” said Rickard.</p>

<p>“Not smoking yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” Rickard was amused at the solicitude. It
was as though he had asked: “Your mother is dying?”</p>

<p>“When will the penance be over?” Marshall lighted
his cigar, watching the blue blaze of the sulphur-tipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
match, the slow igniting of the tobacco—obviously an
exquisite sensuous rite.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a penance! It’s an experiment. I never had
to do anything I really hated to do. I’ve never had to
deny myself anything. Some fellows have to give up
studying the profession they love, go to some hard digging
or other, to support somebody. I’ve been lucky. I
discovered I did not know the meaning of the word
‘sacrifice.’ I buckled down, and gave up the thing I
liked best. That’s all that amounts to.”</p>

<p>His words had a solemn effect. Marshall had stopped
smoking. Rickard discovered that his confidence had
been tactless. Few men had had to sacrifice so much as
the one now somberly facing him. His home, first, because
a civil war had crushed it; his refuge, then, after
years in attics, and struggle with post-bellum prejudices,
just as success met him there; the fulness of life as men
want it—those eyes knew what sacrifice meant!</p>

<p>“When are you going to quit?” Marshall’s face was
still sober.</p>

<p>“When am I going to quit quitting?” laughed his subordinate.
“I haven’t thought it out, sir. When it comes
to me, the inclination, I suppose. I’ve lost the taste for
tobacco.” The break—where those Hardins were—how
in thunder was he going to get out of that, and save his
skin? Marshall liked his own way—</p>

<p>Marshall had resumed his cigar. “We’ll consider it
settled, then.” His minute of introspection was over. He
had picked up his thread.</p>

<p>“Who’s in charge there?” Rickard was only gaining
time. He thought he knew the name he would hear.
Marshall’s first word surprised him.</p>

<p>“No one. Up to a few months ago, it was Hardin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Tom Hardin. He was general manager of the company.
He was allowed to resign, to save his face, as the Chinese
say. I may tell you that it was a case of firing. He’d
made a terrible fluke down there.”</p>

<p>“I know,” murmured Rickard. It was growing more
difficult, more distasteful. If Marshall wanted him to
supplant Hardin! It had been incredible, that man’s
folly! Reckless gambling, nothing else. Make a cut in
the banks of a wild river, without putting in head-gates
to control it; a child would guess better! It was a problem
now, all right; the writer of the report he’d just
read wasn’t the only one who was prophesying failure.
Let the river cut back, and the government works at
Laguna would be useless; a nice pickle Hardin had made.</p>

<p>Still to gain time, he suggested that Marshall tell him
the situation. “I’ve followed only the engineering side
of it. I don’t know the relationship of the two companies.”</p>

<p>“Where the railroad came in? The inside of that
story? I’m responsible—I guaranteed to Faraday the
closing of that break. There was a big district to save,
a district that the railroad tapped—but I’ll tell you that
later.” He was leisurely puffing blue, perfectly formed
rings into the air, his eyes admiring them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ve heard how Estrada, the general,
took a party of men into the desert to sell a mine
he owned. After the deal was made, he decided to let
it slip. He’d found something bigger to do, more to his
liking than the sale of a mine. Estrada was a big man,
a great man. He had the idea Powell and others had, of
turning the river, of saving the desert. He dreamed
himself of doing it. If sickness hadn’t come to him, the
Colorado would be meekly carrying water now, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of flooding a country. Pity Eduardo, the son, is not like
him. He’s like his mother, you never know what they
are dreaming about. Not at all alike, my wife and
Estrada’s.”</p>

<p>Then it came to Rickard that he had heard somewhere
that Marshall and General Estrada had married sisters,
famous beauties of Guadalajara. He began to piece
together the personal background of the story.</p>

<p>“It was a long time before Estrada could get it
started, and it’s a long story. As soon as he began, he
was knocked down. Other men took hold. You’ll hear
it all in the valley. Hardin took a day to tell it to
me! He sees himself as a martyr. Promoters got in;
the thing swelled into a swindle, a spectacular swindle.
They showed oranges on Broadway before a drop of
water was brought in. Hardin has lots of grievances!
He’d made the original survey. So when he sued for
his back wages, he took the papers of the bankrupt company
in settlement. He’s a grim sort of ineffectual bulldog.
He’s clung with his teeth to the Estrada idea.
And he’s not big enough for it. He uses the optimistic
method—gives you only half of a case, half of the
problem, gets started on a false premise. Well, he got
up another company on that method, the Desert Reclamation
Company, tried to whitewash the desert project;
it was in bad odor then, and he managed to bring a few
drops of water to the desert.”</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> Hardin who did that?”</p>

<p>“But he couldn’t deliver enough. The cut silted up.
He cut again, the same story. He was in a pretty bad
hole. He’d brought colonists in already, he’d used their
money, the money they’d paid for land with water, to
make the cuts. No wonder he was desperate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>It recalled the man Rickard had disliked, the rough-shod,
loud-voiced student of his first class in engineering.
That was the man who had made the flamboyant
carpets of the Holmes’ boarding-house impossible any
longer to him. He had a sudden disconcerting vision
of a large unfinished face peering through the honeysuckles
at a man and a girl drawing apart in confusion
from their first, and last, kiss. He wanted to tell Marshall
he was wasting his time.</p>

<p>“Overwhelmed with lawsuits,” Marshall was saying.
“Hardin had to deliver water to those colonists. It was
then that he ran over into Mexico, so as to get a better
gradient for his canal, and made his cut there. You
know the rest. It ran away from him. It made the
Salton Sea.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever give you any reason,” frowned Rickard
reminiscently, “any <i>reasonable</i> reason why he made that
cut without any head-gate?”</p>

<p>“No money!” shrugged Marshall, getting out another
cigar. “I told you he’s a raw dancer, always starts off
too quick, begins on the wrong foot. Oh, yes, he has
reasons, lots of them, that fellow, but as you say, they’re
not reasonable. He never waits to get ready.”</p>

<p>Why was it that the face of the half-sister came to
Rickard then, with that look of sensitive high-breeding
and guarded reserve? And she, a Hardin! Sister to
that loud-spilling mouth! Queer cards nature deals!
And pretty cards Marshall was trying to deal out to
him. Go down there, and finish Hardin’s job, show him
up to be the fumbler he was, give him orders, give the
husband of Gerty Holmes orders—!</p>

<p>“It was Hardin who came to me, but not until he’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
tried everything else. They’d worked for months trying
to dam the river with a few lace handkerchiefs, and
perhaps a chiffon veil!” Marshall was twinkling over
his own humor. “Hardin did put up a good talk. It was
true, as he said; we’d had to move our tracks three,
no, four times, at Salton. It was true that it ought to be
one of the richest districts tapped by the O. P. But he
clenched me by a clever bait—to put out a spur in Mexico
which would keep any other railroad off by a fifty-mile
parallel, and there the sand-hills make a railroad
impossible.</p>

<p>“The government must eventually come to the rescue.
Their works at Laguna hang on the control of the river
down at the Heading. Once, he told me—I don’t know
how much truth there was in it—the Service, Reclamation
Service, did try to buy up their plant for a paltry
sum. He wouldn’t sell. The short is, I recommended
long-sighted assistance to Faraday. I promised to turn
that river, save the district. We expected before the
year was out to have the government take the responsibility
off our hands.”</p>

<p>Rickard made an impatient shrug. A nice problem
Marshall had taken unto himself. He wanted none of
it. Hardin—the thing was impossible.</p>

<p>He met laggardly Marshall’s story. He heard him say:
“Agreed with Faraday. The Desert Reclamation Company
was as helpless as a swaddled infant. We made
the condition that we reorganize the company. I was
put in Hardin’s place as president of the corporation,
and he was made general manager. Of course, we had
to control the stock. We put up two hundred thousand
dollars—Hardin had estimated it would cost us less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
half that! It’s cost us already a million. Things haven’t
been going right. Faraday’s temper burst out, and Hardin,
a while back was asked to resign.”</p>

<p>“And it is Hardin’s position that you want me to
fill?” His voice sounded queer to himself, dry, mocking,
as if any one should know what an absurd thing he was
being asked to do. He felt Marshall’s sharp Indian
eyes on him, as if detecting a pettiness. Well, he didn’t
care how Marshall interpreted it. That place wasn’t
for him.</p>

<p>“I want you in control down there.” Rickard knew
he was being appraised, balanced all over again. It
made no difference—</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he was beginning, when Marshall cut in.</p>

<p>“Good lord, you are not going to turn it down?”</p>

<p>He met Marshall’s incredulous stare. “It’s a job I’d
jump at under most circumstances. But I can’t go, sir.”</p>

<p>Tod Marshall leaned back the full swing of his swivel
chair, blankly astounded. His eyes told Rickard that he
had been found wanting, he had white blood in his veins.</p>

<p>“It is good of you to think of me—pshaw, it is absurd
to say these things. You know that I know it is an honor
to be picked out by you for such a piece of work. I’d
like to,—but I can’t.”</p>

<p>The president of railroads, who knew men, had been
watching the play of feature. “Take your time,” he
said. “Don’t answer too hastily. Take your time.”</p>

<p>He was playing the fool, or worse, before Marshall,
whom he respected, whose partisanship meant so much.
But he couldn’t help it. He couldn’t tell that story—he
knew that Marshall would brush it aside as a child’s
episode. He couldn’t make it clear to the man whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
stare was balancing him why he could not oust Tom
Hardin.</p>

<p>“Is it a personal reason?” Marshall’s gaze had returned
to his ring-making.</p>

<p>Rickard admitted it was personal.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t accept it. I wouldn’t be your friend
if I didn’t advise you to disregard the little thing, to
take the big thing. Maybe, you are going to be married.”
He did not wait for Rickard’s vigorous negative. “That
can wait. The river won’t. Maybe it’s some quixotic
idea, like your smoking; for God’s sake, Rickard, don’t
be quixotic. It’s fine to be quixotic, magnificent, when
you’re young. Oh, you are young to me. But when
you’re no longer young? When you see the opportunity
you did not take wasted, or made splendid, even, by
some other man? Look at me! I could have foresworn
the South, taken a different name after the war, said I
was from England, or from New England. I could have
made a decent living. What did I do? It seemed glorious
to the youngster who had been fighting for his
idea of justice to fight against such a handicap—a beaten
southerner. And I did fight. I fought poverty, cold—I
had a mother back there—I was hungry, often. Sick,
and couldn’t go to a doctor who might have warned me,
because I hadn’t a cent in my pocket. And so, when I
was where I wanted to be, where I’d struggled up to be,
had my hand on the life I loved, in the city I loved, with
the woman I loved, I was knocked down, banished to this
desert if I wanted to live a few more years! Where
if I eat gruel, sleep a child’s night sleep, give up all the
things a man of red blood likes to do, I may live! If
you’d call it that! Just because I’d had no one to talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to me, as I’m talking to you, to tell me I was a young
fool.”</p>

<p>Rickard was looking intently at a slit in the colored
awning. He did not answer.</p>

<p>Marshall looked at the stiff figure facing him. “Your
reason may be sounder than mine, less highfalutin. But
look at it. Balance the other side. Drop yourself out
of it. There’s a river running away down yonder, ruining
the valley, ruining the homes of families men have
carried in with them. I’ve asked you to save them.
There’s a debt of honor to be paid. My promise. I
have asked you to pay it. There’s history being written
in that desert. I’ve asked you to write it. And you say
‘No—’”</p>

<p>“No! I say yes!” clipped Rickard. The Marshall
oratory had swept him to his feet.</p>

<p>The dramatic moment was chilled by their Anglo-Saxon
self-consciousness. An awkward silence hung.
Then:</p>

<p>“When can you go?” Marshall’s voice dropped from
the declamatory. He had already taken up a pencil and
was vaguely scribbling over a writing pad.</p>

<p>“To-day, to-morrow, the first train out.” Rickard
wondered if the scrawls had anything to do with him.</p>

<p>“Good!” Marshall’s tone was hearty, but it had the
finality of “good-by.” He was tracing nebulous figures,
letters. The word, “Oaxaca,” ran out of the blur. Instantly
his mind was diverted.</p>

<p>He had made his appeal, won his point. An hour later,
perhaps, he would be honest in denying the paternity
of some of his flowery phrases were he to be confronted
by the children of his brain. His word of honor—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
had used as his climax. He had never thought of his
business talk with Faraday in that light before, and
never would again. It was a tool, picked up for his
need and thrown away.</p>

<p>Already, he was revolving a spur he was planning for
Oaxaca, in Southern Mexico. An inspiration had come
to him on his walk from The Rosales that morning.
His pencil made some rapid calculations.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he glanced up at the clock, and
saw Rickard standing, as at attention.</p>

<p>“Ah!” He allowed his absorption to betray him.</p>

<p>“I should be off,” discovered Rickard.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied the president of several railroads,
looking at the clock again.</p>

<p>“Any instructions?”</p>

<p>“Just stop that river!”</p>

<p>Rickard again had a humorous vision of himself,
asked to take away a bursting hose from a garden bed.
“How am I limited?” he persisted. He stooped for his
straw hat.</p>

<p>Marshall, still intrigued by his figures, looked up patiently,
inquiringly, nibbling the end of his pencil.</p>

<p>“The expense?” demanded the engineer. “How far
can I go?”</p>

<p>“Damn the expense!” cried Tod Marshall. “Just go
ahead.”</p>

<p>He had begun a swift pencil map of the province of
Oaxaca before Rickard was out of the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE BLESSING OF ARIDITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Rickard left the main line at Imperial
Junction the next afternoon, his eyes followed
the train he was deserting rather than the one that
was to carry him to his new labors. He felt again the
thrill of detachment that invariably preceded his entrance
into a new country. With the pulling up of the
porter’s green-carpeted stool, the slamming of the train
gates, the curtain fell on the Tucson set scene.</p>

<p>The long line of cars was pushing off with its linen-covered
Pullmans and diners, steaming down-grade toward
the Sink, the depression which had been primeval
sea, and then desert, and was now sea again. Old
Beach, rechristened Imperial Junction for railroad convenience,
was itself lower than the ancient sea-line
where once the gulf had reached. Rickard knew he could
find shells at that desert station should he look for them.
He picked up his bag that the porter had thrown on
the ground and faced the rung-down curtain.</p>

<p>Its painted scene was a yellow station-house broiling
under a desert sun; a large water-tank beyond, and in the
distance the inevitable cardboard mountains, like property
scene-shifts, flat and thin in their unreal hues of
burnished pink and purple. A dusty accommodation
train was backing and switching, picking up the empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
refrigerator cars to carry into the valley for the early
melon growers.</p>

<p>Already, the valley had asserted its industrial importance;
the late rampage of the Colorado had made it
spectacular. Those who would pay little attention to
the opening of a new agricultural district in the heart
of a dreaded desert opened their ears to the vagary of
the river which had sportively made of a part of that
desert an inland sea. Scientists were rushing their
speculations into print; would the sea dwindle, by evaporation,
as it had done before? Or would the overflow
maintain the paradoxical sea?</p>

<p>The flood signs were apparent. There, cracks had
split the desert sand; here, water fissures had menaced
the track; and to the south, a fringe of young willows
hid the path of the Colorado’s debouch. The burning
desert sands cried out a sharp antithesis. The yellow
railway house bore all the parched signs of a desert
station. Even the women, with children in their arms,
did not attempt to sit in the stifling waiting-room; they
preferred to stand in the glare.</p>

<p>The men crowding the platform wore the motley of
a new country. In Tucson, the uniform of the male
citizens, with the exception of those reckless ones who
found inevitably that lotus is a liquid, was the wilted
pretense of a gentle civilization; despondent ducks and
khakis and limp collars. Imperial Junction marked the
downfall of the collar. The rest of the composite costume
was irregular, badly laundered and torn, faded
and sunburned; the clothes of the desert soldier. Rickard
saw buttonless shirts, faded overalls, shabby hats—the
sombrero of Mexico. The faces under the broad-brimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hats made a leaping impression upon him of
youth and eagerness. He noted a significant average
of intelligence and alertness. This was not the indolent
group of men which makes a pretense of occupation
whenever a train comes in!</p>

<p>“Going in?” asked a voice at his ear. A pair of
faded eyes set in a young-old face, whether early withered
or well-preserved he had not time to determine,
was staring at him.</p>

<p>He assured his interlocutor that he was going in. His
mood isolated the phrase; its significance vastly different
from “going on.”</p>

<p>“Buying?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“It is a good time to buy.” Rickard suspected a real-estate
agent. “For land is low, rock-bottom prices on
account of the uneasiness about the river. People are
afraid. They want to see the company redeem some of
its promises before they come in; and the company isn’t
in much of a hurry.”</p>

<p>Rickard raised his chin that his collar might bind his
suffering neck in a different place, and then asked what
company he referred to.</p>

<p>The young-old face with the faded eyes looked at him
in surprise. “The D. R. Company, Desert Reclamation,
which brought us all here.”</p>

<p>“Scamps?” The newcomer’s survey of the long line
of naked mountains and lean lands that formed the neck
of the valley gave a snub of casualness to the question.</p>

<p>“No. Fools!” The answer was as swift as a bullet.
“Though some people think them worse than that. I
don’t go so far, I’m willing to say they’ve tried. I’ll
say that much. But they haven’t the know-how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“I’d rather be a scamp than a fool,” ventured Rickard.
“It’s more progressive.” He drew a look of amused
recognition from the faded valley man.</p>

<p>“Newspaper man? No? They are always coming
in now since the break. I’m usually able to spot them.”</p>

<p>“You’ve spotted wrong once,” smiled Rickard, picking
up his bag. The engine was backing the made-up
train toward the station.</p>

<p>The crowd pushed forward. “No offense, I hope,”
called the sun-dried face over the heads of the press.
“I’ve done a little of it myself.”</p>

<p>The window seats, Rickard could see, were filled before
the cars halted, by the experienced ones who had
not waited for the train to be made up. In the scramble,
he spied a vacant window on the sunny side, and made
for it. Seated, he looked for his talkative friend who
was already opening office farther down the car. A
stranger dropped into the seat beside him.</p>

<p>Every window in the car was open. Each red-velveted,
dusty seat was filled. A strong desert wind was
blowing sand into their faces, discoloring the seats and
covering the floor.</p>

<p>The engineer turned to his companion who was coughing.</p>

<p>“Do you mind this window being open?”</p>

<p>“I’d mind if it were not. It’s always bad at the Junction.
When we get into the cultivated country, you will
see what the valley will be like when it is all planted.
The wind is not bad when it blows over grain or alfalfa.
It is the desert dust that nags one.” He coughed again.
“Going in?”</p>

<p>Rickard said he was going in.</p>

<p>“Are you going to settle in the valley?” The inquisitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
was a man of about fifty, Rickard decided, with a
desert tan of apparent health. His face was clear-cut
and intelligent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Just looking the country over?”</p>

<p>“You might call it that.”</p>

<p>“Go slow,” admonished his companion. “Don’t let
yourself be carried away. It is a wonderful country.
But go slow. It’s the ones who expect to make millions
the first year that become the worst knockers. Go slow,
I always tell them. Go slow.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a good time to buy then?”</p>

<p>“Not so good as it was ten years ago! But land is
cheaper than it was a year back. In some districts you
can buy a good farm for a ticket back home, the farmers
are so discouraged. Cold feet.” The slang sounded
oddly, somehow. The man’s voice had the cultivated
precision of the purist. “Cold feet. The river’s chilled
them. The valley’s losing faith in the company.”</p>

<p>“What company?” inquired Rickard again.</p>

<p>“There’s but one company to the valley, the one that
brought them here, the D. R. They don’t call the railroad
The Company. They have nothing to do with that
problem. They won’t recognize that problem! It’s had
hard luck from the first, the D. R. At the very start,
the wrong man got hold of it. Sather, the first promoter,
was a faker; a pretty thorough faker. The company
reorganized, but it’s been in bad odor with the public
ever since.”</p>

<p>Rickard’s eyes left the deep cuts in the land made
by the ravaging waters, and looked at his companion.</p>

<p>“I thought Estrada was the original promoter?” he
inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Estrada’s a recent comer—oh, you mean the general.
He started the ball rolling; that was all. Bad
health, following the Bliss complication, tied his hands.
Did you ever hear the story of the way he colonized
his grant?”</p>

<p>Rickard shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is a good story. I wrote it once for the <i>Sun</i>. I
was out here then. That was before the doctors sent me,
giving me a year if I lived anywhere else. Reclamation
was being talked even then. Estrada picked up the enthusiasm,
and got hold of a big slice of land. The terms
of his purchase were a few cents an acre, fifteen, if I
remember correctly, and a hundred colonists to be established
the first year. Estrada sent in his hundred families,
and did not think it necessary to mention to the
government that he was paying the so-called colonists
a dollar a day. They earned their dollar—it was big
money in those days, two dollars Mexican—by digging
a canal. When the inspector came along—there were
the hundred families. After he was safely out of the
country, Estrada paid and dismissed his colonists. He
had the mile or so of canal and his tract besides. What’s
the difference between fifteen cents and a hundred dollars?
Multiply that by a million and a half, and you can
see what those colonists were to bring to Estrada.
Though they say he died poor.”</p>

<p>The man in the seat ahead was listening. His head
was leonine, his body shriveled. Rickard could see on
the neck the ancient burns that had spared the magnificent
head. The rest of the man had been shriveled and
twisted into terrible deformity. Rickard found himself
puzzling over the accident with its accompanying miracle.
There was not a scar on the powerful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Estrada’s business methods were then not different
from Sather’s and Hardin’s!” It was a deep rich organ.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t class Hardin with Sather,” protested
Rickard’s companion. “Sather <i>used</i> Hardin. Hardin’s
honesty can not be questioned. It’s not money he’s after.
His whole heart is in this reclamation scheme.”</p>

<p>“Hardin’s a false alarm,” growled the owner of the
massive head. “He makes promises. He never keeps
them.”</p>

<p>The older man’s smile was tolerant. “Barton,” he indicated,
“is the president of the water companies. And
if you want to hear about a rogue and a scoundrel, ask
the water companies their opinion of Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Well, what sort of a hole has he got us into?” demanded
the other with heat.</p>

<p>“Hardin’s in a hole himself.”</p>

<p>Rickard found himself admiring the distinction in the
face beside him. The sharp-pointed beard in which the
gray was appearing gave a dog-like keenness to the well-modeled
head, but the sharpness of the features, of the
long slender nose, the long chin and thin eyebrow lines
were offset, curiously, by the mildness, the resignation,
in the steady gray eyes. If fires had ever burned in
them, there were but cold ashes left.</p>

<p>“No one seems to remember that he crucified himself
to save the valley. I’ve a great respect for Thomas
Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” returned Rickard, whose liking had been captured
by the speaker.</p>

<p>The impression of distinction sharpened. The stranger
wore a laundered, pongee silk shirt, open at the neck,
but restricted by a brown silk tie; and it was trimly
belted. There were but two neckties in the entire car,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and they occupied, Rickard observed, the same seat.</p>

<p>“The beginning of the canal system.”</p>

<p>Rickard looked out upon a flat one-toned country,
marked off in rectangles by plows and scrapers. Farther
south, those rectangles were edged by young willows.
He fancied he could see, even at that distance, the gleam
of water.</p>

<p>It was the passing of the desert. A few miles back,
he had seen the desert in its primitive nakedness which
not even cactus relieved. He was passing over the land
which men and horses were preparing for water. And
he could see the land where water was.</p>

<p>“That was the way Riverside looked when I first saw
it,” commented the other man who wore a tie. “Come
out on the rear platform. We can see better.”</p>

<p>Rickard followed to the back of the dust-swept stifling
car. The glare on the platform was intense. He stood
watching the newly made checker-board of a country
slip past him. Receding were the two lines of gleaming
steel rails which connected and separated him from the
world outside. He was “going in.” Not in Mexico
even had he had such a feeling of ultimate remoteness.
The mountains, converging perspectively toward the
throat of the valley, looked elusive and unreal in their
gauze draperies of rose and violet. The tender hour of
day was clothing them with mystery, softening their
sharp outlines. They curtained the world beyond. Rickard
felt the suspense of the next act.</p>

<p>It was a torpid imagination, he thought, which would
not quicken over this conquest of the desert. East of
the tract, men and teams were preparing the newly-furrowed
ground for the seed. The curved land-knives
were breaking up the rich earth mold into ridges of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
soft soil as uncohesive and feathery as pulverized chocolate.
It was the dark color of the chocolate of commerce,
this silt which had been pilfered from the states
through which the vagrant river wandered. The smell
of the upturned earth, sweetly damp, struck against his
nostrils. Rickard indulged a minute of whimsical fancy;
this was California territory over which his train was
passing, but the soil, that dark earth those blades were
crumbling, was it not the tribute of other states, of despoiling
Wyoming, of ravishing Colorado and Arizona?</p>

<p>To the west, new squares were being leveled and outlined.
Shrubby rectangles were being cleared of their
creosote-bush and tough mesquit. Compared with other
countries, the preparation for planting was the simplest.
Horses were dragging over the ground a railroad rail
bent into a V angle which pulled the bushes by the roots
and dragged them out of the way. Beyond, farther
west, could be seen the untouched desert. The surface
for many miles was cracked by water-lines, broken and
baked into irregular sand-cakes; the mark of sand which
has been imprisoned by water and branded by swift
heat.</p>

<p>Close by, men were putting in with care the seed that
was to quicken the river silt. They were passing a square
where the green tips of the grain were piercing the
ground. Now, they were abreast of a field of matured
alfalfa over which the wind raced gratefully. Desert
and grain field; death and life! The panorama embraced
the whole cycle.</p>

<p>“Excuse me. I did not hear you.” His new acquaintance
had been endeavoring to get his attention.</p>

<p>The valley man tried to pitch his voice above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
rattle of the train, but the effort ended in spasmodic
coughing. The attacks left him weak and gasping.</p>

<p>“Better go back,” suggested Rickard. He followed the
stranger who waved him to the seat by the open window.
He busied himself with the sliding landscape,
withholding his sympathy. He could hear the man drawing
in long deep breaths. “Poor devil! He’s had his
sentence!” he gathered.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the other leaned over his shoulder,
his hand waving toward the passing mountains.
“Those are the Superstition Mountains you can see over
yonder. An unusually apt name.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“An accidental hit of some tired traveler,” hazarded
the colorless lips. “He had probably been listening to
the legends of some unusually garrulous Indian; could
not find the germ of universal religion in the simple creed,
so he called it,—the nameless mountains—‘Superstition.’
I’ve always wished I knew his own name, that we might
credit him, this late, with the inspiration. Have you ever
thought,” he deflected, “how many familiar names are
unsponsored? Take the Colorado, for instance. Melchior
Diaz called it the Rio del Tizon; Alarçon, for
diplomatic reasons, gave it Rio de la Buena Guia; Onate
changed it to the Rio Grande de Buena Esperanza, and
it was Kino, the Jesuit padre, who christened it in
memory of the blessed martyrs Rio de los Martires. Who
called it first the Colorado? History shuts her lips. And
who will ever call it anything else?”</p>

<p>Rickard was attracted by the man’s educated inflection,
as well as by his musing. “Why Superstition?” he
queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Why is it good, you mean? That pile of dark rock
stands as a monument to an effete superstition. It is
the gravestone for a gigantic mistake. Why, it was only
the grossest ignorance that gave to the desert the label
of ‘bad lands.’ The desert is a condition, not a fact.
Here you see the passing of the condition, the burial of
the superstition. Are you interested in irrigation?”</p>

<p>Rickard was not given to explain the degree of interest
his profession involved, for the stranger drew a painful
breath, and went on.</p>

<p>“Of course you are, if you are a western man. You
are, I think?”</p>

<p>The engineer said that he was, by choice.</p>

<p>“Irrigation is the creed of the West. Gold brought
people to this country; water, scientifically applied, will
keep them here. Look at this valley. What was it a
few years ago? Look at Riverside. And we are at the
primer stage only. We are way behind the ancients in
information on that subject. I learned at school, so did
you, that some of the most glorious civilizations flourished
<i>in spite of the desert</i> which surrounded them. That
was only half a truth. They were great <i>because</i> of it!
Why did the Incas choose the desert when their strength
gave them the choice of the continent of South America?
Why did the Aztecs settle in the desert when they might
easily have preempted the watered regions? Then there
are the Carthaginians, the Toltecs, the Moors. And one
never forgets Egypt!”</p>

<p>“For protection,” Rickard gave the slighted question
an interested recognition. “Was that not what we were
taught at school? The forest held foes, animal and
human. Those nations grew to their strength and power
in the desert, by virtue of its isolation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Superstition!” retorted the man with the pointed
beard. “We are babes at the breast measured by the
wisdom of the men who settled Damascus, or compared
with the Toltecs, or those ancient tribes who settled in
Northern India. They recognized the value of aridity.
They knew its threefold worth.”</p>

<p>“An inherent value?” demanded the college-bred man,
turning from the window.</p>

<p>“An inherent value,” declared the exponent of aridity.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me just what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Not in one session! Look yonder. That’s Brawley.
When I came through here, ten years ago, I could have
had my pick of this land at twenty-five cents an acre.
They were working at this scheme then—on paper. I
was not alive to the possibilities then; I had not yet lived
in Utah!”</p>

<p>The train was slowing up by a brand-new, yellow-painted
station. There were several dusty automobiles
waiting by the track, a few faded surreys, and the inevitable,
country hotel bus. The platform was swarming
with alert vigorous faces, distinctly of the American
type.</p>

<p>The man in the seat beside him asked Rickard if he
observed the general average of intelligence in the faces
of the crowd below. Rickard acknowledged that he had
been struck by that, not only here, but at Imperial Junction,
where he had waited for the train.</p>

<p>“There is a club in the valley, lately started, a university
club which admits as members those who have had at
least two years of college training. The list numbers
three hundred already. The first meeting was held last
week in an empty new store in Imperial. If it had not
been for the setting, we might have been at Ann Arbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
or Palo Alto. The costumes were a little motley, but
the talk sounded like home.”</p>

<p>The dust, blowing in through the car doors, brought
on another fit of strangling. Rickard turned again to the
window, to the active scene which denied the presence
of desert beyond.</p>

<p>“The doctors say it will have to be the desert always
for me.” The stranger tapped his chest significantly.
“But it is exile no longer—not in an irrigated country.
For the reason of irrigation! It is the progressive man,
the man with ideas, or the man who is willing to take
them, who comes into this desert country. If he has
not had education, it is forced upon him. I saw it
worked out in Utah. I was there several years. Irrigation
means cooperation. That is, to me, the chief value
of aridity.”</p>

<p>The wind, though still blowing through the car and
ruffling the train dust, was carrying less of grit and sand.
To the nostrils of Rickard and his new acquaintance, it
brought the pleasing suggestion of grassy meadows, of
willow-lined streams and fragrant fields.</p>

<p>“It is the accepted idea that this valley is attracting a
superior class of men because of its temperance stand.
It is the other way round. The valley stood for temperance
because of the sort of men who had settled here,
the men of the irrigation type.”</p>

<p>The engineer’s ear criticized “irrigation type.” He
began to suspect that he had picked up a crank.</p>

<p>“The desert offers a man special advantages, social,
industrial and agricultural. (I would invert that arrangement
if I made over that sentence!) It is no accident
that you find a certain sort of man here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean that the struggle necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
develop such a country, under such stern conditions, develops
of necessity, strong men?” evolved Rickard. “Oh,
yes, I believe that, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, more than that. It is not so much the struggle,
as the necessity for cooperation. The mutual dependence
is one of the blessings of aridity.”</p>

<p>“One of the blessings of aridity!” echoed his listener.
“You are a philosopher.” He had not yet touched the
other’s thought at the spring.</p>

<p>“You might as well call me a socialist because I praise
irrigation in that it stands for the small farm unit,” retorted
the valley man. “That is one of its fiats; the
small unit. It is the small farm that pays. That fact
brings many advantages. What is the charm of
Riverside? It comes to me always like the unreal dream
of the socialist come true. It is a city of farms, of small
farms, where a man may make his living off his ten acres
of oranges, or lemons; and with all the comforts and
conveniences of a city within reach, his neighbors not
ten miles off! A farmer in Riverside, or in any irrigated
community, does not have to postpone living for himself
or his family, until he can sell the farm! He can
go to church, can walk there; the trolley car which passes
his door takes him to a public library, or the opera-house.
His children ride to school. His wife does not
need to be a drudge. The bread wagon and the steam-laundry
wagon stop at her door.”</p>

<p>Rickard observed that perhaps he did not know anything
about irrigation after all! He had not thought
of it before in its sociological relation, but merely as it
touched his profession.</p>

<p>“Not going into soil values, for that is a long story,”
began the older man, “irrigation is the answer which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
science gives to the agriculturist who is impatient of
haphazard methods. Irrigation is not a compromise,
as so many believe who know nothing about it. It is a
distinct advantage over old-fashioned methods.”</p>

<p>“I am one of those who always thought it a compromise,”
admitted the engineer.</p>

<p>“Better call rain a compromise,” retorted the irrigationist.
“The man who irrigates gives water to the tree
which needs it; rain nourishes one tree, and drowns out
another. Irrigation is an insurance policy against
drought, a guarantee against floods. The farmer who
has once operated an irrigated farm would be as impatient
were he again subjected to the caprice of rain as
a housewife would be were she compelled to wait for
rain to fill her wash-tub. There is no irregularity or
caprice about irrigation.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how the old fellow picked it all up?” mused
Rickard with disrespect. Aloud he said—“You were
speaking of the value of the soil?”</p>

<p>“Look at the earth those plows are turning over. See
how rich and friable it is, how it crumbles? You can
dig for hundreds of feet and still find that sort of soil,
eight hundred feet down! It is disintegrated rock and
leaf mold brought in here in the making of a delta.
Heavy rainfalls are rare here, though we have had them,
in spite of popular opinion. Were we to have frequent
rains, the chemical properties, which rain-farmers must
buy to enrich their worn-out soils, would be leached
out, drained from the soil. I can’t make this comprehensive,
but I’ve a monograph on desert soil. If you are
interested, I’ll send it to you.”</p>

<p>“I should like it—immensely,” assented the engineer,
still amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“It explains the choice of the Aztecs, of the Incas, of
Carthaginians, the Moors,” observed the stranger. “They
chose the desert, not in spite of the soil, but because of
it. I doubt if they were awake to the social advantages
of the system, but it was their cooperative brotherhood
that helped them to their glory. We are centuries behind
them. Look what the acceptance of the superstition
has already cost California! The Mexican Boundary
Survey Commission did its work pretty thoroughly
until familiarity with the bad lands they were plodding
through confirmed the old superstition. The international
line was to cut across at the mouth of Hardy’s
Colorado. When the surveyors struck the Gila, they
assumed it was the river they wanted it to be; anyway,
it did not matter; it was ‘bad land,’ where even the
Indians were thinning, where only scorpions and rattlers
could flourish. The line was drawn there, and California
lost all that area of desert land. However, a lady got
her silk gown!”</p>

<p>The last words were as spice to a tasteless pudding.
“A silk gown!” It sounded piquant.</p>

<p>“That’s a page of unwritten history,” said the stranger,
rising. “I’m getting out here; Imperial. If you come
up to Imperial, look me up. Brandon’s my name. I’ve
no card these days!”</p>

<p>“There are several things I want to hear from you,”
answered Rickard, rising also, and following the pointed
beard to the platform. “I’ll be sure to look you up.
Mine’s Rickard.”</p>

<p>“There’s my residence,” waved Brandon. “That tent
over yonder?” All of Imperial was easily seen from
the car platform. “No, that is a canvas house. There
is a great difference,—in distinction!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Rickard liked the nicety of speech which to the critical
ear is as pleasing as wit. He watched Brandon step off
the car, saw him greeted and surrounded by a knot of
station watchers.</p>

<p>“Hello, Brandon,” Rickard could hear them hail him.
“Back home, Brandon?” “Treated you well at Palm
Springs?”</p>

<p>“Poor devil,” he thought again. “Trying Palm Springs
for his cough. Wonder who the old duck is. Country
newspaper, I fancy. He did say he had reported for the
<i>Sun</i>.”</p>

<p>The young-old man who had spoken to him at the
Junction, pushed past with some bundles. He stopped
when he saw Rickard.</p>

<p>“I get out here. If you come to Imperial, hunt me
up. I run the <i>Star</i>, the only newspaper in the valley.
Glad to meet you.”</p>

<p>“Disposing of my theory about Brandon,” smiled the
engineer, going back into the dusty car. He was interested
enough to lean over and ask Barton who was the
man called Brandon. They could see him from the windows,
still surrounded, still smiling that sweet ascetic
smile.</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon they call him. He’s one of the old
settlers. Was with Powell, on the second expedition
down the river. Then was one of the big men on the
<i>Sun</i>.” He tapped his chest significantly. “Bad; came
West, folks thought to die. There’s lots of grit in the
old fellow. He’s written a history of the Colorado River
that reads like a novel, they say. I’ve never read it. I
never read books. I’m lucky if I can get time for a newspaper,
and I don’t often get a newspaper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Rickard observed that “Captain Brandon” seemed to
be well informed on the subject of irrigation.</p>

<p>“That’s his hobby, that and desert soil. He’s writing
a book on irrigation, not half done yet, but it’s already
sold. He’s published a pamphlet on desert soil. Oh,
he knows his subject.”</p>

<p>“College man?”</p>

<p>“Harvard, I think, and then either an English or German
university. I’ve heard, but I’ve forgotten by now.
He’s lived in the West, everywhere they’ve tried irrigation;
in Utah, Colorado, California, and he’s been to
Egypt and Syria and all the classic places. Studying,
but he came back again, nearly dead. He goes up to
Palm Springs every little while to get toned up, taken
care of. Poor devil!”</p>

<p>The breeze, which was now entering the car windows,
had blown over clover-leafed fields. Its message was
sweet and fresh. Rickard could see the canals leading
off like silver threads to the homes and farms of the
future; “the socialists’ dream come true!” Willows of
two or three years’ growth outlined the banks. Here
and there a tent, or a ramada, set up a brave defiance
against the hard conditions of the land it was invading.
Rickard leaned out of the window, and looked back, up
the valley which was dominated by the range now wrapping
around itself gauzy iridescent draperies.</p>

<p>“The monument to an effete superstition!” he repeated.
“That wasn’t a bad idea. I hope he won’t forget to
send me his monograph.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE DESERT HOTEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE left the dusty car with relief when the twin
towns were called. The sun, plunging toward
the horizon, was sending out long straight shafts of
yellow light, staining the railroad buildings a deeper
hue and playing queer tricks with faces and features.
The yellow calcium isolated two stalwart Indians whose
painted faces and streaming black hair, chains of tawdry
beads and floating ribbons made the vacuity of their
brown masks a grotesque contrast. Their survey of the
train and the jostling passengers, was as dispassionate
and incurious as though this brisk invasion carried no
meaning nor menace to them.</p>

<p>Rickard had expected to see a Mexican town, or at
least a Mexican influence, as the towns hugged the
border, but it was as vividly American as was Imperial
or Brawley. There was the yellow-painted station of
the Overland Pacific lines, the water-tank, the eager
American crowd. Railroad sheds announced the terminal
of the road. Backed toward the station was the inevitable
hotel bus of the country town, a painted board
hanging over its side advertising the Desert Hotel. Before
he reached the step, the vehicle was crowded.</p>

<p>“Wait, gen’lemen, I’m coming back for a second
load,” called the darky who was holding the reins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“If you wait for the second trip, you won’t get a
room,” suggested a friendly voice from the seat above.</p>

<p>Rickard threw his bag to the grinning negro, and
swung on to the crowded steps.</p>

<p>Leaving the railroad sheds, he observed a building
which he assumed was the hotel. It looked promising,
attractive with its wide encircling veranda and the patch
of green which distance gave the dignity of a lawn. But
the darky whipped up his stolid horses. Rickard’s
eyes followed the patch of green.</p>

<p>The friendly voice from above told him that that was
the office of the Desert Reclamation Company. His next
survey was more personal. He saw himself entering the
play as the representative of a company that was distrusted,
if not indeed actively hated by the valley folk.
It amused him that his entrance was so quiet as to be
surreptitious. It would have been quieter had Marshall
had his way. But he himself had stipulated that Hardin
should be told of his coming. He had seen the telegram
before it left the Tucson office. He might be assuming
an unfamiliar rôle in this complicated drama of river and
desert, but it was not to be as an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>“Going in to settle?” The friendly voice belonged, he
could see through the press of arms and limbs, to a pair
of alert eyes and a faded buttonless shirt that had once
been blue.</p>

<p>“I did that before I left!” He was tired of the question.</p>

<p>There was a laugh from the seats above.</p>

<p>“Going to try Calexico?”</p>

<p>“I think Calexico is going to try me! If this dust is
a sample!”</p>

<p>“Wonder if they are so eager to welcome settlers because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
they are all real-estate agents, or if the valley movement
is a failure?” reflected the newcomer.</p>

<p>The heavy bus was plowing slowly through the dust
of the street. Rickard was given ample time to note the
limitations of the new town. They passed two brick
stores of general merchandise; lemons and woolen goods,
stockings and crackers disporting fraternally in their
windows. A board sign swinging from the overhanging
porch of the most pretentious building announced the
post-office. From a small adobe hung a brass plate advising
the stranger of the Bank of Calexico. The ’dobe
pressed close to another two-storied structure of the
desert type. The upper floor, supported by posts, extended
over the sidewalk. Netted wire screened away
the desert mosquito, and gave the overhanging gallery
the grotesque appearance of a huge fencing mask. From
the street could be seen rows of beds; as in hospital
wards. Calexico, it was seen, slept out-of-doors.</p>

<p>“Desert Hotel,” bawled the darky, reining in his
placid team.</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, I’ll look out for your bag. Got your room?
The hotel’s mighty sure to be full. Not many women
yit down this a-way.... All the men mostly lives
right heah at the hotel.”</p>

<p>Rickard made a dive from a swirl of dust into the
hotel. The long line he anticipated at the desk was not
there. He stopped to take in a valley innovation. One
end of the long counter had been converted into a soda-water
bar. The high swivel stools in front of the white
marbled stand, with its towering silver fixtures, were
crowded with dust-parched occupants of the bus. A
white-coated youth was pouring colored sirups into tall
glasses; there was a clinking of ice; a sizzling of siphons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“That’s a new one on me,” grinned Rickard, turning
toward the desk where a complacent proprietor stood
waiting to announce that there was but one room left.</p>

<p>“With bath?”</p>

<p>“Bath right across the hall. Only room left in the
house.” The proprietor awarded him the valley stare.
“Going to be here long?” He passed the last key on the
rack to the darky staggering under a motley of bags
and suit-cases. Rickard recognized his, and followed.</p>

<p>“I may get you another room to-morrow,” called the
proprietor after him as he climbed the dusty stairs.</p>

<p>Rickard decided that the one room was not only hot
and stifling, but dirty. The darky thrust his bag
through the door and left the guest staring at the bed.
He pulled back the covers; dust and sand of apparently
a week’s accumulation lined the sheets. The red, gaily-flowered,
Brussels carpet was gritty with sand. Rickard
rubbed a reflective finger over the surface of the golden-oak
bureau.</p>

<p>A middle-aged chambermaid with streaming rusty
hair, entering without ceremony, caught his grimace.</p>

<p>“It’s not as bad as it looks. I cleaned it up this morning.
It’s the wind. Ain’t it awful? I’ve known people
to come into this place when the wind has been blowing
as it has to-day, and seen them leave as soon as they seen
their bed. They had to come back, as there’s no other
place to go, and they’d be no better if there was. But
Mr. Patton, that’s the boss, has me go around regular
now, and explain. It saves his time. I’ll fix it up for
you, so you can be easy as to its being new dirt. It’ll
be just as bad as this when you come to go to bed.”</p>

<p>Rickard washed his hands, and fled, leaving the
berserker to the clouds of fury she had evoked. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
soda-counter was deserted. The youth, divested of his
white coat, was relieving Mr. Patton at the register.
Rickard followed the sound of voices.</p>

<p>The signals of a new town were waving in the dining-room.
The majority of the citizens displayed their shirt-sleeves
and unblushing suspenders. One large table was
surrounded by men in khaki; the desert-soldiers, engineers.
The full blown waitresses, elaborately pompadoured,
were pushing through the swing-doors, carrying
heavy trays. Their transparent shirt-waists of coarse
embroidery or lace were pinned to rusty, badly hung
skirts of black alpaca. An apron, the size of a postage
stamp, was the only badge of servitude. Coquetry appeared
to be their occupation, rather than meal-serving,
the diners accepting both varieties of attention with appreciation.
The supremacy of those superior maidens
was menaced only by two other women who sat at a
table near the door. Rickard did not see them at first.
The room was as masculine as a restaurant in a new
mining town.</p>

<p>A superior Amazon inquired if the gentleman would
like vermicelli soup? As he did not even glance at her
magnificent pompadour, he was punished by being served
last through the entire bill of fare.</p>

<p>He had two men at his table. They were engrossed
with their course of boiled beef and spaghetti. Iced tea,
instead of wine, was the only variation from the conventional,
country hotel dinner.</p>

<p>Rickard left his indoor view to look through the
French windows opening on a side street. He noticed
a slender but regular procession. All the men passing
fell in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Cocktail route,” explained one of his neighbors, his
mouth full of boiled beef.</p>

<p>“Oyster cocktail?” smiled the newcomer.</p>

<p>“The real thing! Calexico’s dry, like the whole valley,
that is, the county. See that ditch? That is Mexico, on
the other side. Those sheds you can see are in Mexicali,
Calexico’s twin sister. That painted adobe is the custom
house. Mexicali’s not dry, even in summer! You
can bet your life on that. You can get all the bad
whisky and stale beer you’ve the money to buy. We
work in Calexico, and drink in Mexicali. The temperance
pledge is kept better in this town than any other
town in the valley. But you can see this procession every
night.”</p>

<p>The Amazon with a handkerchief apron brought
Rickard his soup. He was raising his first spoonful to
his mouth when he saw the face, carefully averted, of
the girl he had met at the Marshalls’ table, Innes Hardin.
His eyes jumped to her companions, the man a stranger,
and then, Gerty Holmes. At least, Mrs. Hardin! Somehow,
it surprised him to find her pretty.</p>

<p>She had achieved a variety of distinction, preserving,
moreover, the clear-cut babyish chin which had made its
early appeal to him. There was the same fluffy hair,
its ringlets a bit artificial to his more sophisticated eyes,
the same well-turned nose. He had been wondering
about this meeting; he found that he had been expecting
some sort of shock—who said that the love of to-day
is the jest of to-morrow? The discovery that Gerty
was not a jest brought the surprised gratification which
we award a letter or composition written in our youth.
Were we as clever as that, so complete at eighteen or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
twenty-one? Could we, now, with all our experience, do
any better, or indeed as well? That particular sentence
with wings! Could we make it fly to-day as it soared
yesterday? Rickard was finding that Gerty’s more mature
charms did not accelerate his heart-beats, but they
were certainly flattering to his early judgment. And
he had expected her to be a shock!</p>

<p>He was staring into his plate of chilled soup. Calf-love!
For he had loved her, or at least he had loved
her chin, her pretty childish way of lifting it. She was
prettier than he had pictured her. Queer that a man
like Hardin could draw such women for sister and wife—the
blood tie was the most amazing. For when women
come to marry, they make often a queer choice. It occurred
to him that that might have been Hardin—he
had not wanted to stare at them.</p>

<p>That was not Hardin’s face. It held strength and
power. The outline was sharp and distinct, showing the
strong lines, the determined mouth of the pioneer. There
was something else, something which stood for distinction—no,
it couldn’t be Hardin.</p>

<p>And then, because an outthrust lip changed the entire
look of the man, Rickard asked his table companions,
who was the man with the two ladies, near the door.</p>

<p>“That, suh,” his neighbor from Alabama became immediately
oratorical, “that is a big man, suh. If the Imperial
Valley ever becomes a reality, a fixtuah, it will be
because of that one man, suh. Reclamation is like a
seed thrown on a rock. Will it stick? Will it take root?
Will it <i>grow</i>? That is what we all want to know.”</p>

<p>Rickard thought that he had wanted to know something
quite different, and reminded the gentleman from
Alabama that he had not told him the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“The father of this valley, of the reclamation of this
desert, Thomas Hardin, suh.”</p>

<p>Rickard tried to reset, without attracting their attention,
the group of his impressions of the man whose
personality had been so obnoxious to him in the old
Lawrence days. The Hardin he had known had also
large features, but of the flaccid irritating order. He
summoned a picture of Hardin as he had shuffled into
his own class room, or up to the long table where Gerty
had always queened it among her mother’s boarders. He
could see the rough unpolished boots that had always
offended him as a betrayal of the man’s inner coarseness;
the badly fitting coat, the long awkward arms,
and the satisfied, loud-speaking mouth. These features
were more definite. Could time bring these changes?
Had <i>he</i> changed, like that? Had they seen him? Would
Gerty, would Hardin remember him? Wasn’t it his
place to make himself known; wave the flag of old
friendship over an awkward situation?</p>

<p>He found himself standing in front of their table,
encountering first, the eyes of Hardin’s sister. There
was no surprise, no welcome there for him. He felt
at once the hostility of the camp. His face was uncomfortably
warm. Then the childish profile turned on him.
A look of bewilderment, flushing into greeting—the
years had been kind to Gerty Holmes!</p>

<p>“Do you remember me, Rickard?”</p>

<p>If Hardin recognized a difficult situation, he did not
betray it. It was a man Rickard did not know who
shook him warmly by the hand, and said that indeed
he had not forgotten him.</p>

<p>“I’ve been expecting you. My wife, Mr. Rickard, and
my sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Why, what are you thinking of, Tom? To introduce
Mr. Rickard! I introduced you to each other, years
ago!” Gerty’s cheeks were red. Her bright eyes were
darting from one to the other. “You knew he was coming,
and did not tell me?”</p>

<p>“You were at the Improvement Club when the telegram
came,” put in Innes Hardin, without looking at
Rickard. No trace of the Tucson cordiality in that proud
little face! No acknowledgment that they had met at
the Marshalls’!</p>

<p>“Oh, you telegraphed to us?” The blond arch smile
had not aged. “That was friendly and nice.”</p>

<p>Rickard had not been self-conscious for many a year.
He did not know what to say. He turned from her
upturned face to the others. Innes Hardin was staring
out of the window, over the heads of several crowded
tables; Hardin was gazing at his plate. Rickard decided
that he would get out of this before Gerty discovered
that it was neither “friendly nor nice.”</p>

<p>“If I had known that you were here, I would have
insisted on your dining with us, in our tent. For it’s
terrible, here, isn’t it?” She flashed at him the look he
remembered so vividly, the childish coquettish appeal.
“We dine at home, till it becomes tiresome, and then
we come foraging for variety. But you must come to
us, say Thursday. Is that right for you? We should
love it.”</p>

<p>Still those two averted faces. Rickard said Thursday,
as he was bidden, and got back to his table, wondering
why in thunder he had let Marshall persuade him
to take this job.</p>

<p>Hardin waited a scant minute to protest: “What
possessed you to ask him to dinner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Why shouldn’t I? He is an old friend.” Gerty caught
a glance of appeal, from sister to brother. “Jealous?”
she pouted charmingly at her lord.</p>

<p>“Jealous, no!” bluffed Hardin.</p>

<p>He thought then that she knew, that Innes had told
her. The Lawrence episode held no sting to him. Once,
it had enchanted him that he had carried off the boarding-house
belle, whom even that bookman had found
desirable—bookman! A superior dude! He had always
had those grand airs. As if it were not more to a man’s
credit to struggle for his education, even if he were
older than his class, or his teacher, than to accept it off
silver plates, handed by lackeys? Rickard had always
acted as if it had been something to be ashamed of. It
made him sick.</p>

<p>“They’ve done it this time. It’s a fool choice.”</p>

<p>Again, that look of pleading from Innes. Gerty had a
shiver of intuition.</p>

<p>“Fool choice?” Her voice was ominously calm.</p>

<p>Hardin shook off Innes’ eyes. Better be done with
it! “He’s the new general manager.”</p>

<p>“He’s the general manager!”</p>

<p>“I’m to take orders from him.”</p>

<p>Gerty’s silence was of the stunned variety. The
Hardins watched her crumbling bread on the table-cloth,
thinking, fearfully, that she was going to cry.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you?” Her voice, repressed, carried
the threat of tears. “Didn’t I tell you how it would be?
Didn’t I say that you’d be sorry if you called the railroad
in?”</p>

<p>“Must we go over this again?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me? Why did you let me make a
goose of myself?” She was remembering that there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
been no protest, no surprise from Innes. She knew!
A family secret! She shrugged. “I’m glad, on the
whole, that you planned it as a surprise. For I carried
it off as if we’d not been insulted, disgraced.”</p>

<p>“Gerty!” expostulated Hardin.</p>

<p>“Gerty!” implored Innes.</p>

<p>“And we are in for a nice friendly dinner!”</p>

<p>“Are you quite finished?” Hardin got up.</p>

<p>As the three passed out of the dining-room, Rickard
caught their several expressions: Hardin’s stiff, indifferent;
Gerty’s brilliant but hard, as she flashed a finished,
brave little smile in his direction. The sister’s bow was
distinctly haughty.</p>

<p>In the hall, Gerty’s laugh rippled out. It was the
laugh Rickard remembered, the light frivolous cadence
which recalled the flamboyant pattern of the Holmes’
parlor carpet, the long, crowded dining-table where
Gerty had reigned. It told him that she was indifferent
to his coming, as she meant it should. And it turned
him back to a dark corner in the honeysuckle draped
porch where he had spent so many evenings with her,
where once he had held her hand, where he told her
that he loved her. For he had loved her, or at least
he thought he had! And had run away from her expectant
eyes. A cad, was he, because he had brought
that waiting look into her eyes, and had run from it?</p>

<p>Should a man ask a woman to give her life into his
keeping until he is quite sure that he wants it? He was
revamping his worn defense. Should he live up to a
minute of surrender, of tenderness, if the next instant
brings sanity, and disillusionment? He could bury now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
forever self-reproach. He could laugh at his own vanity.
Gerty Hardin, it was easy to see, had forgotten
what he had whispered to Gerty Holmes. They met as
sober old friends. That ghost was laid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A GAME OF CHECKERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE uneasy mood of the desert, the wind-blown
sand, drove people indoors the next morning.
Rickard was served a substantial, indifferently cooked
breakfast in the dining-room of the Desert Hotel, whose
limitations were as conspicuous to the newcomer as they
were non-existent to the other men. They were finding
it a soft contrast to sand-blown tents, to life in the open.</p>

<p>Later, he wandered through the group of staring idlers
in the office, past the popular soda-stand and the few
chair-tilters on the sidewalk, going on, as if without
purpose, to the railroad sheds, and then on, down to the
offices of the Desert Reclamation Company. He discovered
it to be the one engaging spot in the hastily
thrown-together town. There were oleanders, rose and
white, blooming in the patch of purple blossoming alfalfa
that stood for a lawn. Morning-glories clambered
over the supports of the veranda, and on over the roof.
Rickard’s deductions led him to the Hardins.</p>

<p>What school of experience had so changed the awkward
country fellow? He had resented his rivalry, not
that he was a rival, but that he was a boor. His kisses
still warm on her lips, and she had turned to welcome,
to coquet with Tom Hardin! The woman who was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
be his wife must be steadier than that! It had cooled
his fever. Not for him the aspen who could shake and
bend her pretty boughs to each rough breeze that blew!</p>

<p>Men tossed into a desert, fighting to keep a foothold,
do not garland their offices with morning-glories! Was
it the gracious quiet influence of a wife, a Gerty Hardin?
The festive building he was approaching was as
unexpected—as Captain Brandon! Rickard walked on,
smiling.</p>

<p>He was fairly blown into the outer room, the door
banging behind him. Every one looked up at the noisy
interruption. There were several men in the long room.
Among them two alert, clean-faced youths, college-graduates,
or students out on furlough, the kind of stuff
in his class at Lawrence. Three of the seasoned, road-coached
type were leaning their chairs against the cool
thick walls. One was puffing at a cigar. The other, a
big shy giant, was drawing clouds of comfort from a
pipe. There was a telegraph operator at work in one
end of the room, her instrument rapidly clicking. In
an opposite corner was a telephone exchange. A girl
with a metal band around her forehead was punching
connections between the valley towns. Rickard lost the
feeling of having gone into a remote and isolated region.
The twin towns were on the map.</p>

<p>One of the older men returned his nod. The young
men returned their hastily withdrawn attention to their
game of checkers. The other smoker was watching with
cross-eyed absorption the rings his cigar was sending
into the air. Rickard might not have been there.</p>

<p>One of the checker players looked up.</p>

<p>“Anything I can do for you? Do you want to see
any one in particular?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“No,” it was admitted. “No one in particular. I was
just looking round.”</p>

<p>“It’s the show place of Calexico. I’ll take you around.
It is the only place in town that is comfortable when
it’s hot, or when the wind blows, and that’s the program
all summer. Take my place, Pete.”</p>

<p>Pete, the young giant, with the face of his infancy enlarged
rather than matured, slipped into the vacant chair.
He had been the first to discover the stranger, but he
had evaded the responsibility. The game immediately
absorbed him.</p>

<p>“It’s nice here,” repeated the young fellow, leading
the way. They were followed by a few idle glances.</p>

<p>Rickard looked with approval at the tall slim figure
which was assuming the courtesy of the towns. The
fine handsome face was almost too girlish, the muscles
of the mouth too sensitive yet for manly beauty, but he
liked the type. Lithe as a young desert-reared Indian,
his manner and carriage told of a careful home and
rigid school discipline.</p>

<p>It was the type Rickard liked, he was thinking, because
it was the type he understood. He preferred
the rapier to the bludgeon, the toughened college man
to the world-veneered man of the field. He revered the
progress of a Jefferson or a Hamilton; he would always
distrust the evolution of a contemporary Lincoln. It is
easier, he maintained, to skip classes, or grades in world
discipline, than in a rigorous college. This was the kind
which in his own classes had attracted him. He had
missed them in his years on the road—in Mexico, Wyoming,
North Dakota, where rough material had been
his to shape.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a large cool room. The furnishings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
he inventoried: a few stiff chairs, a long table and
a typewriter desk, closed for the Sabbath.</p>

<p>“The stenographer’s room,” announced the lad superfluously.</p>

<p>“Whose stenographer?”</p>

<p>“General property, now. Every one has a right to use
her time. She used to be Hardin’s, the general manager’s.
She is his still, in a way. But Ogilvie keeps
her busy most of the time.”</p>

<p>Rickard had not heard of Ogilvie. He made a mental
register.</p>

<p>“When did Hardin go out?” He knew the date himself.
He expected the answer would trail wisps of other
information. He had a very active curiosity about
Hardin. The man’s failures had been spectacular.</p>

<p>The young fellow was thinking aloud. “The dam
went November twenty-ninth. Hardin was given a
decent interval to resign. Of course, he was fired. It
was an outrage—” He remembered that he was speaking
to a stranger, and broke off suddenly. Rickard did
not question him. He made another note. Why was
it an outrage, or why did it appear so? In perspective,
from the Mexican barranca, where he had been at the
time, the failure of that dam had been another bar
sinister against Hardin.</p>

<p>“I see that you are from the University of California?”
he said, following his courier to the door that opened
on a long covered inner porch. Another lawn of alfalfa
rested the eyes weary of dust and sand. A few
willows and castor-beans of mushroom habit shut out
the desert, denied the lean naked presence just beyond
the leafy screen. Rickard nodded at the pin of gold
and blue enamel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Out for a year,” glowed the lad. “Dad wanted me
to get some real stuff in my head. He said the Colorado
would give me more lessons—more real knowledge
in a year than I’d get in six at college. I kicked
up an awful row—”</p>

<p>The older man smiled. “Of course. You didn’t want
to leave your class.”</p>

<p>“You’re a college man, then.” Rickard uncovered
his “frat” pin under his vest lapel. “Father wasn’t. He
couldn’t understand. It was tough.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to go back now?”</p>

<p>The boy made a wry face. “He expects me to go
back in August. Says I must. Think I’d leave the
desert if the Colorado goes on another rampage? Miss
the chance of a lifetime? I’ll make him see it. If I
don’t, I’ll buck, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You did not tell me your name,” was suggested.</p>

<p>“MacLean, George MacLean,” said the young man
rather consciously. It was a good deal to live up to.
He always felt the appraisement which followed that
admission. George MacLean, elder, was known among
the railroad circles to be a man of iron, one of the strongest
of the heads of the Overland Pacific system. He
was not the sort of man a son could speak lightly of
disobeying.</p>

<p>“Of course, every one calls me Junior.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll go back if he wants you to,” smiled
Rickard.</p>

<p>“Oh, but what a rotten trick it would be!” exclaimed
the son of the man of iron. “To throw me out of college—I
was daffy to finish with my class, and to get me
here, to get me interested—and then after I’ve lost my
place to pull me back. Why, there are things happening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
every day that are a liberal education. They are
only just beginning to understand what they are bucking
up against. The Colorado’s an unknown quantity,
even old engineers are right up against it. There are
new problems coming up every day. The Indians call
her a yellow dragon, but she’s a tricky woman, she’s
an eel; she’s giving us sums to break our teeth on.”</p>

<p>The man smiled at the eager mongrel imagery.</p>

<p>“I’ll not go,” said MacLean.</p>

<p>“Fathers seem wise the year after where they seem
blind the year before!”</p>

<p>“I’ll not go!” the boy blustered. Rickard suspected
that he was bolstering up his courage.</p>

<p>“Who has the next room?”</p>

<p>“Used to be the general manager’s. Ogilvie uses it
now.”</p>

<p>“And who did you say was Ogilvie?” They turned
back into the room.</p>

<p>“You can go in. He’s not here. He is the new auditor,
an expert accountant from Los Angeles. Put in
by the O. P. when it assumed control last year. He
used to come down once a month. After Hardin went
out, he came down to stay.”</p>

<p>“Whose say-so?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The accounts were rotten, that’s no
office secret. The world knows that. Hardin is blamed
for it. It isn’t fair. Look at Sather’s stone palace
in Los Angeles. Look at Hardin’s tent, his shabby
clothes.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to meet Ogilvie,” observed the general manager.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not much to meet. A pale white-livered
vegetarian, a theosophist. You’ve seen ’em. Los Angeles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
is full of ’em. He was here when Hardin was
fired. You could see him see his opportunity. His
chest swelled up. He looked as if he had tasted meat
for the first time. He thought that he could woozle
into the empty place! He went back to Los Angeles,
convinced them that the auditor should be here, protect
the company’s interests. It sounded mysterious, sleuth-like,
as if he had discovered something, so they let him
bring the books down here. He is supposed to be ferreting.
But he’s ‘woozling.’ He used to be in the
outer office. Said the noise made his head ache, so he
moved in here. All the committee meetings are held
here, and occasionally the directors’ meetings. Water
companies’, too. Ogilvie’s taking notes—wants to be
the next general manager, it sticks out all over him.”</p>

<p>“What’s the derivation of woozle?” this with deep
gravity.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see Ogilvie!” laughed his entertainer.
Then as an afterthought: “This is all public gossip.
He’s fair game.”</p>

<p>The door opened behind them, and Rickard saw the
man whose description had been so deftly knocked off.
He recognized the type seen so frequently in Southern
California towns, the pale damaged exile whose chance
of reprieve is conditioned by stern rules of diet and sobriety.
It was the temperament which must perforce
translate a personal necessity into a religious dogma.</p>

<p>“This gentleman’s just,—is just looking around,”
stammered MacLean, blundering, confused.</p>

<p>The vegetarian nodded, taking off his felt sombrero
and putting it on a chair with care.</p>

<p>The stranger observed that he had pleasant quarters.</p>

<p>Ogilvie said that they answered very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Are there other offices than those I have seen?”
Rickard demanded of MacLean.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Dormitories. We sleep here,
a lot of us when we are not on duty. At least, we don’t
sleep inside, unless it blows us in. We sleep out there.”
He nodded in the direction of the lawn. “We dress and
‘gas’ in there.” His hand waved toward the rooms beyond.</p>

<p>By this time it was apparent that no one, save Hardin,
knew of his coming. He was ahead of Marshall’s letters.
He did not like the flavor of his entrance.</p>

<p>“What provision is being made for a new general
manager?”</p>

<p>The question, aimed carelessly, hit the auditor.</p>

<p>“They are not talking of filling the position just yet,”
he responded. “There is no need, at present. The work
is going along nicely, better I might say, adjusted as it
now is, than it did before.”</p>

<p>“I heard that they had sent a man from the Tucson
office to represent Mr. Marshall.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear his name?” stammered Ogilvie.</p>

<p>“Rickard.”</p>

<p>The auditor recovered himself. “I would have heard
of it, were it true. I am in close touch with the Los
Angeles office.”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Ogilvie’s dismay was too sudden;
the flabby facial muscles betrayed him.</p>

<p>“I’m Rickard.” The new general manager took the
swivel chair behind the flat-top desk. “Sit down. I’d
like to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me,” Ogilvie’s bluff was as anemic
as his crushed appearance. “I—I am busy this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
morning. Might I—trouble you—for a few minutes?
My papers are in this desk.”</p>

<p>Rickard now knew his man to the shallow depths
of his white-corpuscled soul. “If I won’t be in your
way, I’ll hang around here. I’ve the day to kill.”</p>

<p>His sarcasm was lost in transit. Ogilvie said that
Mr. Rickard would not be in his way. He would move
his papers into the next room to-morrow.</p>

<p>The engineer moved to the French windows that
opened on the alfalfa lawn. A vigorous growth of
willows marked the course of New River which had cut
so perilously near the towns. A letter, “b,” picked out
in quick river vegetation told the story of the flood.
The old channel, there it was; the curved arm of the
“b,” one could tell that by the tall willows, had been
too tortuous, too slow for those sweeping waters. The
flow had divided, cutting the stem of the letter, carrying
the flood waters swifter down-grade. The flow had
divided,—hm! divided perhaps the danger, too! An
idea in that! He would see that better from the water-tower
he’d spied at entering. Another flood, and a
gamble whether Mexicali or Calexico would get the
worst of it. Unless one was ready. A levee—west of
the American town!</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir—do you need me?” He turned back
into the room. He could see that MacLean was aching
to get out of the room. Ogilvie had visibly withered.
A blight seemed to fall on him as his white blue-veined
fingers made a bluff among his papers.</p>

<p>“Thank you.” Rickard nodded at MacLean, who
burst into the outer office.</p>

<p>“It’s the new general manager from Tucson—Rickard’s
his name.” His whisper ran around the walls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the room where other arrivals were tilting their chairs.
“The new general manager! Ogilvie woozled for nothing.
You should have seen his face!”</p>

<p>“Did any one know that he was coming?” Silent, the
tanned giant, spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s Marshall all over,” said Wooster, bright-eyed
and wiry, removing his pipe. “He likes to move in a
mysterious way his wonders to perform. (Used to sing
that when I was a kid!) No announcement. Simply:
‘Enter Rickard!’”</p>

<p>“More like this,” said Silent. “Exit Hardin. Enter
Ogilvie. Enter Rickard.”</p>

<p>“And exit Ogilvie,” cried MacLean.</p>

<p>“It’s a—damned shame,” burst out Wooster. No one
asked him what he meant. Every man in the room was
thinking of Hardin whose shadow this reclamation
work was.</p>

<p>“What’s Rickard doing?” asked the infantile Hercules
at the checker-board. The force called him Pete,
which was a short cut to Frederick Augustus Bodefeldt.</p>

<p>“Taking Ogilvie’s measure,” this from MacLean.</p>

<p>“Then he’s doing something else by this time. That
wouldn’t take him five minutes unless he’s a gull,”
snapped Wooster, who hated Ogilvie as a rat does a
snake.</p>

<p>The door opened and Rickard came in. Almost simultaneously
the outer door opened to admit Hardin. Who
would introduce the new general manager to the dismissed
one? The thought flashed from MacLean to
Silent, to the telegraph operator. Bodefeldt doubled
over the checker-board, pretending not to see them. Confusion,
embarrassment was on every face. Nobody
spoke. Hardin was coming closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Hello, Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Rickard.”</p>

<p>It appeared friendly enough to the surprised office.
Both men were glad that it was over.</p>

<p>“Nice offices,” remarked Hardin, his legs outspread,
his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Ogilvie is satisfied with them.” The men rather
overdid the laugh.</p>

<p>“Finding the dust pretty tough?” inquired Hardin.</p>

<p>“I spent a month in San Francisco last summer!” was
the rejoinder. “This is a haven, though, from the street.
Thought I’d loaf for to-day.” Was Hardin game to
do the right thing, introduce him as the new chief to
his subordinates? Nothing, it developed, was further
from his intention. Hardin, his legs outstretched, kept
before his face the bland impenetrable smile of the
oriental. It was clearly not Rickard’s move. The
checker players fidgeted. Rickard’s silence was interrogative.
Hardin still smiled.</p>

<p>The outer door opened.</p>

<p>The newcomer, evidently a favorite, walked into a
noisy welcome, the “boys’” embarrassment overdoing it.
He was of middle height, slender; a Mexican with
Castilian ancestry written in his high-bred features, his
grace and his straight dark hair.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Estrada,” said Hardin with the
same meaningless smile.</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen.” The Mexican’s greeting
paused at Rickard.</p>

<p>“Mr. Estrada, Mr. Rickard.”</p>

<p>Every one in the office saw Hardin snub his other opportunity.
He had betrayed to every one his deep hurt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
his raw wound. When he had stepped down, under
cover of a resignation, he had saved his face by telling
every one that a rupture with Maitland, one of the directors
of the reorganized company, had made it impossible
for them to serve together, and that Maitland’s wealth
and importance to the company demanded his own sacrifice.
Two months before Rickard’s appearance, Maitland
had been discovered dead in his bath in a Los Angeles
hotel. Though no one had been witless enough
to speak of their hope to Hardin, he knew that all his
force was daily expecting his reinstatement. Rickard’s
entrance was another stab to their chief.</p>

<p>“The son of the general?” The new manager held
out his hand. “General Estrada, friend of Mexican
liberty, founder of steamship companies and father of
the Imperial Valley?”</p>

<p>“That makes me a brother of the valley,” Estrada’s
smile was sensitive and sweet.</p>

<p>“He did good work in his day,” added Rickard rather
stupidly.</p>

<p>Estrada looked at Hardin, hesitated, then passed on to
the checker players, and stood behind MacLean.</p>

<p>“I saw your father in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>MacLean’s eager face flushed. “Did you speak to
him? Did you tell him how hard it would be for me to
go back?”</p>

<p>“I did what I could. But it was a busy time. There
were several meetings of the board. At the last two,
he was present.”</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>“He was chosen to fill the vacancy made by Maitland’s
death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>MacLean’s eyes wavered toward Hardin, whose nonchalance
had not faltered. Had he not heard, or did
he know, already?</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a meeting, a conference, to-morrow
morning.” Rickard was speaking. “Mr. Hardin, will
you set the hour at your convenience?”</p>

<p>Because it was so kindly done, Hardin showed his
first resentment. “It will not be possible for me to be
there. I’m going to Los Angeles in the morning.” He
turned and left the office, Estrada following him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Hardin, you mustn’t take it that way,” he
expostulated, concern in each sensitive feature.</p>

<p>“I’ll take orders from him, but he gave me none,”
growled Hardin. “It’s not what you think. I’m not
sore. But I don’t like him. He’s a fancy dude. He’s
not the man for this job.”</p>

<p>“Then you knew him before?” It was a surprise to
Estrada.</p>

<p>“At college. He was my—er, instructor. Marshall
found him in the class room. A theory-slinger.”</p>

<p>Estrada’s thoughtful glance rested on the angry face.
Was this genuine, or did not Hardin know of the years
Rickard had served on the road; of the job in the heat-baked
barrancas of Mexico where Marshall had “found”
him? But he would not try again to persuade Hardin
to give up his trip to Los Angeles. It might be better,
after all, for the new manager to take charge with his
predecessor out of the way.</p>

<p>“MacLean’s coming down to-night,” he threw out,
still watching Hardin’s face. “With Babcock.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be missed.” Hardin’s mouth was bitter.
“Estrada, if I had the sense of a goat, I’d sell out, sell
my stock to MacLean, and quit. What’s in all this, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
me? Does any one doubt my reason for staying? It
would be like leaving a sinking ship, like deserting the
passengers and crew one had brought on board. God!
I’d like to go! But how can I? I’ve got hold of the
tail of the bear, and I can’t let go!”</p>

<p>“No one doubts you—” began Estrada. Hardin
turned away, with an ugly oath. The Mexican stood
watching his stumbling anger. “Poor Hardin!”</p>

<p>In the office, Rickard was speaking to MacLean, whom
he had drawn to one side, out of ear-shot of the checker
players.</p>

<p>“I want you to do something for me, not at all agreeable!”
His tone implied that the boy was not given the
chance to beg off. “What time does the train pull out
in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Six-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a letter for you, at the hotel at six. Be on
time. I want to catch Hardin before he leaves for Los
Angeles. If he’s really going. I’ll give him to-day to
think it over. But he can’t disregard an order as he did
my invitation. I didn’t want to rub it in before the men.”</p>

<p>MacLean stared; then said that he thought he was
not likely to!</p>

<p>Rickard left the office in time to see Hardin shutting
the outer gate behind him. His exit released a chorus
of indignant voices.</p>

<p>“An outrage!”</p>

<p>“A damned shame!” This from Wooster.</p>

<p>“Hardin’s luck!”</p>

<p>On the other side of the door, Rickard deliberated.
The hotel and its curious loungers, or his new office,
where Ogilvie was making a great show of occupation?
He had not seen Estrada. He was making a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
dive for his hotel, when the gentle voice of the Mexican
hailed him.</p>

<p>“Will you come to my car? It’s on the siding right
here. We can have a little lunch, and then look over
some maps together. I have some pictures of the river
and the gate. They may be new to you.”</p>

<p>Rickard spent the afternoon in the car. The twin
towns did not seem so hostile. He thought he might
like the Mexican.</p>

<p>Estrada was earning his father’s mantle. He was the
superintendent of the road which the Overland Pacific
was building between the twin towns and the Crossing;
a director of the Desert Reclamation Company; and the
head of a small subsidiary company which had been created
to protect rights and keep harmonious relation with
the sister country. Rickard found him full of meat, and
heard, for the first time consecutively, the story of the
rakish river. Particularly interesting to him was the
relation of Hardin to the company.</p>

<p>“He has the bad luck, that man!” exclaimed Estrada’s
soft tuneful voice. “Everything is in his hands,
capital is promised, and he goes to New York to have
the papers drawn up. The day he gets there, the <i>Maine</i>
is destroyed. Of course, capital is shy. He’s had the
devil’s own luck with men: Gifford, honest, but mulish;
Sather, mulish and not honest—oh, there’s a string of
them. Once, he went to Hermosillo to get an option on
my father’s lands. They were already covered by an
option held by some men in Scotland. Another man
would have waited for the three months to pass. Not
Hardin. He went to Scotland, thought he’d interest
those men with his maps and papers. He owned all the
data, then. He’d made the survey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Estrada repeated the story Brandon and Marshall had
told, with little discrepancy. A friendly refrain followed
the narrative. “He has the bad luck, that man!”</p>

<p>“And the Scotched option?” reminded Rickard, smiling
at his own poor joke.</p>

<p>“It was just that. A case of Hardin luck again. He
stopped off in London to interest some capital there;
following up a lead developed on the steamer. He was
never a man to neglect a chance. Nothing came of it,
though, and when he reached Glasgow, he found his man
had died two days before. Or been killed, I’ve forgotten
which. Three times Hardin’s crossed the ocean trying
to corner the opportunity he thought he had found. It
isn’t laziness, is his trouble. It’s just infernal luck.”</p>

<p>“Or over-astuteness, or procrastination,” criticized his
listener to himself. He knew now what it was that had
so changed Hardin. A man can not travel, even though
he be hounding down a quick scent, without meeting
strong influences. He had been thrown with hard men,
strong men. It was an inevitable chiseling; not a miracle.</p>

<p>“I want to hear more of this some day. But this map.
I don’t understand what you told me of this by-pass, Mr.
Estrada.”</p>

<p>Their heads were still bending over Estrada’s rough
work-bench when the Japanese cook announced that dinner
was waiting in the adjoining car. MacLean and
Bodefeldt and several young engineers joined them.</p>

<p>It had been, outwardly, a wasted day. Rickard had
lounged, socially and physically. But before he turned
in that night, he had learned the names and dispositions
of his force; and some of their prejudices. Nothing, he
summed up, could be guessed from the gentleness of the
Mexican’s manner; Wooster’s antagonism was open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and snappish. Silent was to be watched; and Hardin
had already shown his hand.</p>

<p>The river, as he thought of it, appeared the least formidable
of his opponents. He was imaging it as a high-spirited
horse, maddened by the fumbling of its would-be
captors. His task it was to lasso the proud stallion, lead
it in bridled to the sterile land. No wonder Hardin was
sore; his noose had slipped off one time too many!
Hardin’s <i>luck</i>!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>RED TAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT ten o’clock the next morning, Hardin, entering the
office, again the general manager’s, found there before
him, George MacLean the new director, and Percy
Babcock, the treasurer, who had been put in by the Overland
Pacific when the old company was reorganized.
They had just come in from Los Angeles, the trip made
in MacLean’s private car.</p>

<p>“Where’s Estrada?” inquired Hardin of Ogilvie, who
was making a great show of industry at the desk in the
center of the room.</p>

<p>Before Ogilvie could open his deliberate lips, Hardin’s
question was answered by Babcock, a thin nervous man,
strung on live wires. “Not here yet.”</p>

<p>Hardin stood in his characteristic attitude, legs outstretched,
his hands in his pockets. “Rickard?”</p>

<p>“Coming back, Ogilvie says. He went out a few minutes
ago.”</p>

<p>“Just like Marshall, that.” Hardin moved over to the
leather lounge where MacLean was sitting. Neither man
answered him. It was Hardin’s method of acknowledging
the situation.</p>

<p>Rickard entered a few minutes later, Estrada behind
him. Ogilvie followed Rickard to his desk.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired the new manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Ogilvie explained lengthily that he had the minutes of
the last meeting.</p>

<p>“Leave them here.” Rickard waved him toward Estrada,
who held out his hand for the papers.</p>

<p>Ogilvie’s grasp did not relax. He stammered: “There
is no secretary. I’ve been taking the minutes—”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Mr. Estrada will read them. We do not
need you, Mr. Ogilvie.”</p>

<p>Ogilvie stood, turning his expressionless eyes from one
director to the other as if expecting that order to be
countermanded. Babcock and MacLean appeared to be
looking at something outside through the vine-framed
windows. An ugly smile disfigured Hardin’s mouth.</p>

<p>Rickard spoke again. “Mr. Estrada! We won’t detain
you any longer, Mr. Ogilvie.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, the accountant relinquished the papers.
His retreating coat tails looked ludicrously whipped, but
no one laughed. Hardin’s scowl deepened.</p>

<p>“Showing his power,” he thought. “He’s going to call
for a new pack.”</p>

<p>Estrada pushed the minutes through with but a few
unimportant interruptions. He was sitting at the same
desk with Rickard. Hardin, sensitive and sullen, thought
he saw the meeting managed between them. “It’s all
slated,” ran his angry blood. “The meeting’s a farce.
It was all fixed in Los Angeles, or in Marshall’s office.”
He whipped himself into rebellion. He was no baby.
He knew about these matters better than these strangers,
this fancy dude! He’d show them!</p>

<p>It took their silent cooperation to hold him down. It
became more apparent to him that they were all pitted
against him. He was being pressed against the wall.</p>

<p>Several times he attempted to bring the tangled affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of the water companies before the directors. Rickard
would not discuss the water companies.</p>

<p>“Because he’s not posted! He’s beginning to see
what he’s up against,” ran Hardin’s stormy thoughts.
He felt Rickard’s hand in this, although it was Estrada,
apparently, who shelved the mystifications of the uneasy
companies, their rights, their dissatisfactions and their
lawsuits. Babcock seconded the Mexican’s motion to
discuss those issues at the next meeting. “It is a put-up
job,” sulked Tom Hardin.</p>

<p>He was on his feet the next minute with a motion to
complete the Hardin head-gate. Violently he declaimed
to Babcock and MacLean his wrongs, the injustice that
had been done him. Marshall had let that fellow Maitland
convince him that the gate was not practicable; had
it not been for him, the gate would be in place now; all
this time and money saved. And the Maitland dam,
built instead! Where was it? Where was the money,
the time, put in that little toy? Sickening! His face
purpled over the memory. Why was he allowed to begin
again with the gate? “Answer me that. Why was
I allowed to begin again? It’s all child’s play, that’s what
it is. And when I am in it again, up to my neck, he pulls
me off.”</p>

<p>This was the real Hardin, the uncouth, overaged Lawrence
student! The new manner was just a veneer.
Rickard had been expecting it to wear thin.</p>

<p>“Why did we begin it, I ask you?” repeated Hardin,
his face flushed and eager. “To make laughing-stocks of
ourselves down here? That’s a costly game for the O. P.
to play. What does Marshall know about conditions,
sitting in his office, and looking at maps, and reading letters
and reports from his spies? I’ll give you the answer:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
he wants the glory himself. Why did he tell me
that he thought my gate would go, and then start another
ten times as costly? He wants all the credit. He’d
like to see my gate a failure. Why does he push the
concrete gate ahead, and hold up mine every few days?”</p>

<p>“I think,” interjected Rickard, “that we all agree with
Mr. Marshall, Mr. Hardin, that a wooden head-gate on
silt foundation could never be more than a makeshift.
I understood that the first day he visited the river with
you he had the idea to put the ultimate gate, the gate
which would control the water supply of the valley, up
at the Crossing on rock foundation. Mr. Marshall does
not expect to finish that in time to be of first use. He
hopes the wooden gate will solve the immediate problem.
It was a case of any port in a storm. He has asked me
to report my opinion.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he give me a chance to go ahead then?”
growled the deposed manager. “Instead of letting the
intake widen until it will be an impossibility to confine
the river there at all?”</p>

<p>“So you do think that it will be an impossibility to
complete the gate as planned?”</p>

<p>Hardin had run too fast. “I didn’t mean that,” he
stammered. “I mean it will be difficult if we are delayed
much longer.”</p>

<p>“You are in charge of the construction of that gate?”</p>

<p>Hardin said he was. If it had not been for the
floods—</p>

<p>“Have you the force to re-begin work at once?” demanded
Rickard.</p>

<p>“I had it,” evaded Hardin. “I had everything ready
to go on—men, material—when we stopped the last
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“And you haven’t it now?”</p>

<p>Hardin hated to the soul of him to have to acknowledge
that he had not; he shrank from uncovering a single
obstacle that stood between his gate and completion.
He tried to hedge. MacLean, a big man whose iron
wheels moved slowly, was weighing the caliber of the
two opposing men. Babcock, wiry, alert, embarrassed
Hardin with his challenging stare.</p>

<p>“Answer my question, please.”</p>

<p>“I should have to assemble them again,” admitted
Hardin sulkily.</p>

<p>Rickard consulted his note-book. “I think we’ve covered
everything. Now, I want to propose the laying of
a spur-track from Hamlin’s Junction to the Heading.”
His manner cleared the stage of supernumeraries; this
was the climax. Hardin looked ready to spring.</p>

<p>“And in connection with that, the development of a
quarry in the granite hills back of Hamlin’s,” continued
Rickard, not looking at Hardin.</p>

<p>Instantly Hardin was on his feet. His fist thundered
on the table. “I shall oppose that,” he flared. “It is absolutely
unnecessary. We can’t afford it. Do you know
what that will cost, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“One hundred thousand dollars!” Rickard interrupted
him. “I want an appropriation this morning for that
amount. It is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary if we
are to save the valley. We can not afford not to do it,
Mr. Hardin!”</p>

<p>Hardin glared at the other men for support; he found
MacLean’s face a blank wall; Estrada looked uncomfortable.
Babcock had pricked up his ears at the sound
of the desired appropriation; his head on one side, he
looked like an inquisitive terrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Hardin spread out his hands in helpless desperation.
“You’ll ruin us,” he said. “It’s your money, the O. P.’s,
but you’re lending it, not giving it to us. You are going
to swamp the Desert Reclamation Company. We can’t
throw funds away like that.” One hundred thousand
dollars! Why, he could have stopped the river any time
if he had had that sum; once a paltry thousand would
have saved them—“I didn’t ask the O. P. to come in
and ruin us, but to stop the river; not to throw money
away in hog-wild fashion.” He was stammering inarticulately.
“There’s no need of a spur-track if you rush
my gate through.”</p>

<p>“<i>If</i>,” Rickard nodded. “Granted. If we can rush it
through. But suppose it fails? Marshall said the railroad
would stand for no contingencies. The interests
at stake are too vital—”</p>

<p>“Interests!” cried Tom Hardin. “What do you know
of the interest at stake? You or your railroad? Coming
in at the eleventh hour, what can you know? Did you
promise safety to thousands of families if they made
their homes in this valley? Are you responsible? Did
you get up this company, induce your friends to put their
money in it, promise to see them through? What do
you know of the interests at stake? You want to put
one hundred thousand dollars into a frill. God, do you
know what that means to <i>my</i> company? It means
ruin—” Estrada pulled him down in his seat.</p>

<p>Rickard explained to the directors the necessity in his
opinion of the spur-track and the quarry. Rock in great
quantities would be needed; cars must be rushed in to
the break. He urged the importance of clenching the
issue. “If it’s not won this time, it’s a lost cause,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
maintained. “If it cuts a deeper gorge, the Imperial
Valley is a chimera; so is Laguna Dam.”</p>

<p>The other men were drawn into the argument. Babcock
leaned toward Hardin’s conservatism. MacLean
was judicial. Estrada upheld Rickard. The spur-track,
in his opinion, was essential to success. Hardin could
see the meeting managed between the newcomer and the
Mexican, and his anger impotently raged. His temper
made him incoherent. He could see Rickard, cool and
impersonal, adding to his points, and MacLean slowly
won to the stronger side. Hardin, on his feet again, was
sputtering helplessly at Babcock, when Rickard called
for a vote. The appropriation was carried. Hardin’s
face was swollen with rage.</p>

<p>Rickard then called for a report on the clam-shell
dredge being rushed at Yuma. Where was the machinery?
Was it not to have been finished in February?</p>

<p>Hardin said that the machinery was ready, waiting in
San Francisco. The hull of the dredge could not be finished
for a couple of months at least.</p>

<p>“Why not get the machinery here? What’s the use of
taking chances?” demanded Rickard.</p>

<p>Hardin felt the personal implication. He was on his
feet in a second. “There are no chances.” He looked at
MacLean. “The machinery’s done. It’s no use getting
it here until we’re ready.”</p>

<p>“There are always chances,” interrupted his opponent
coolly. “We are going to take none. I want Mr. Hardin,
gentlemen, appointed a committee of one to see that the
machinery is delivered at once, and the dredge rushed.
What’s the date?”</p>

<p>“April eleventh,” clicked the nickel-in-the-slot-machine-Babcock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
again. Had any one asked the time, his answer
as swift without consultation would have been as exact.
He lived with his watch under his eye. Every few minutes
he assured himself as to his gain on eternity.</p>

<p>“Get it in before the heavy summer traffic begins,”
instructed Rickard.</p>

<p>The working force was informally discussed. Hardin
said they could depend on hobo labor. His enthusiasm
took fire; he saw the work begun on his gate. “That
class of men flock like bees to such work as this. There’s
no trouble getting them; they just drop in. Curious, isn’t
it, how such fellows keep track of the world’s work?
You build a levee, you begin a bridge, and there’s your
hobo on the spot. It’s good labor, too, though it’s fickle.”
It was the other Hardin, the chiseled man of affairs
and experience. Rickard agreed that they would find
such help, but it would not do to rely on it. The big
sewer system of New Orleans was about completed; he
had planned to write there, stating the need. And there
was a man in Zacatecas, named Porter—</p>

<p>“Frank Porter?” sneered Hardin, “that—murderer?”</p>

<p>“His brother,” Rickard answered pleasantly. “Jim
furnishes the men for the big mines in Sonora and Sinaloa.
He’ll send us all the labor we want, the best for our
purpose. When it gets red-hot, there’s no one like a
peon or an Indian.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be infringing on the international contract
law,” suggested MacLean.</p>

<p>“No. The camp is on the Mexican side,” laughed
Casey. “I’d thought of that. We’ll have them shipped
to the nearest Mexican point, and then brought to the
border. Mr. Estrada will help us.”</p>

<p>The meeting had already adjourned. They were standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
around the flat-top desk. Estrada invited them all
to lunch with him, in the car on the siding. MacLean
said that he had to get back to Los Angeles. Mr. Babcock
was going to take him out to Grant’s Heading in
the machine. He had never been there. They had breakfasted
late. He looked very much the colonel to Rickard,
his full broad chest and stiff carriage made more
military by his trim uniform of khaki-colored cloth.</p>

<p>“May I speak to you about your boy, Mr. MacLean?”</p>

<p>Hardin caught a slight that was not intended. He
pushed past the group at the door without civility or
ceremony.</p>

<p>The steady grave eyes of the big frame looked at
Rickard inquiringly.</p>

<p>“He wants to stay out another year. I hope you will
let him. It’s not disinterested. I shall have to take a
stenographer to the Heading this summer. There is a
girl here; I couldn’t take her, and then, too, I’m old-fashioned;
I don’t like women in offices. My position
promises to be a peculiar one. I’d like to have your son
to rely on for emergencies a stenographer could not
cover.”</p>

<p>MacLean’s grave features relaxed as he looked down
on the engineer, who was no small man himself, and
suggested that his son was not very well up in stenography.</p>

<p>“That’s the least of it.”</p>

<p>“I hope that he will make a good stenographer! Good
morning, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>At table, neither Estrada nor his guest uncovered their
active thought which revolved around Hardin and his
hurt. Instead, Rickard had questions to ask his host
on river history. As they talked, it came to him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
something was amiss—Estrada was accurate; he had all
his facts. Was it enthusiasm, sympathy, he lacked?
Presently he challenged him with it.</p>

<p>Estrada’s eyes dreamed out of the window, followed
the gorge of the New River, as though out there, somewhere,
the answer hovered.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, do you <i>doubt</i> it?” exclaimed Rickard,
watching the melancholy in the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>Estrada shook his head, but without decision. “Nothing
you’d not laugh at. I can laugh at it myself, sometimes.”</p>

<p>Rickard waited, not sure that anything more was coming.
The Mexican’s dark eyes were troubled; a puzzle
brooded in them. “It’s a purely negative sense that I’ve
had, since I was a child. Something falls between me
and a plan. If I said it was a veil, it would be—something!”
His voice fell to a ghost of tunefulness. “And
it’s—nothing. A blank—I know then it’s not going to
happen. It is terribly final! It’s happened, often. Now,
I wait for that—veil. When it falls, I know what it
means.”</p>

<p>“And you have had that—sense about this river business?”</p>

<p>Estrada turned his pensive gaze on the American.
“Yes, often. I thought, after father’s death, that that
was what it meant. But it came again. It kept coming.
I had it while you were all talking, just now. I don’t
speak of this. It sounds chicken-hearted. And I’m in
this with all my soul—my father—I couldn’t do it any
other way, but—”</p>

<p>“You think we are going to fail?”</p>

<p>“I can’t see it finished,” was Estrada’s mournful answer.
He turned again to stare out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>An odd sense of unreality rested for an instant on
Rickard. Swiftly he rejected it. Outside, the sunshine,
the work to be done, the river running wild—</p>

<p>“You’ve been too much in the valley, Mr. Estrada!”
Estrada looked at him, and then his glance went back
to the car window. His silence said plainly: “Oh, I
knew you would not believe me!”</p>

<p>“I mean, this country gets on men’s nerves. It’s so—omnipotent!
The victories are all to the river’s side, as
yet. We’re pygmies, fighting Titans. We fear what we
have never conquered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” He could see that Estrada would not
argue with him. “Oh, we all get that. The personal feeling,
as if it were really a dragon, and we trying to shackle
it with our wisps of straw!”</p>

<p>“A few lace handkerchiefs and a chiffon veil!” sang
Rickard’s memory.</p>

<p>“We get the sense of being resented, of angry power.
We feel like interlopers in this desert. She tells us all,
in her own terrible, silent way, ‘You don’t belong here!’”</p>

<p>“That has been quoted to me, silently, too!” laughed
Rickard. And they were on solid ground again.</p>

<p>“Who are the river-men in the valley?” demanded the
newcomer. “I want to meet them, to talk to them.”</p>

<p>“Cor’nel, he’s an Indian. He’s worth talking to. He
knows its history, its legends. Perhaps some of it is history.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he to be found?”</p>

<p>“You’ll run across him! Whenever anything’s up, he
is on hand. He senses it. And then there’s Matt Hamlin.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him, of course. Has he been up the river?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll tell you two who have. Maldonado, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
half-breed, who lives some twenty miles down the river
from Hamlin’s. He knows the Gila as though he were
pure Indian. The Gila’s tricky! Maldonado’s grandfather
was a trapper, his great-grandfather, they say, a
priest. The women were all Indian. He’s smart. Smart
and bad.”</p>

<p>Estrada’s Japanese servant came back into the car to
offer tea, freshly iced.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want, smart river-men, not tea!”
laughed Rickard. “I want river history.”</p>

<p>“There’s another man you ought to meet.” Before he
spoke the name, Rickard had a flash of telepathy; he
knew Estrada would say, “Brandon.”</p>

<p>“He was with the second Powell expedition. He’s
written the book on the river. He knows it, if any man
does.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I’d forgotten about him. I think I’ll run
up and have a talk with him.”</p>

<p>“This instant?” smiled the Mexican, for his guest had
risen. “There’s no train out until to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Mr. MacLean to take a passenger. That will
save me several hours; and an uncomfortable trip.”</p>

<p>“You wanted these maps.” Estrada was gathering
them together.</p>

<p>Queer, how that name had flashed from Estrada’s mind
to his. He hadn’t thought about Brandon—there was
something in it, in the vitality, the force of thought. If
that were true, then why not the other, that odd sense
that Estrada spoke of? Seeing clear!</p>

<p>“Your maps, Mr. Rickard!”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And you can just strangle that foreboding
of yours, Mr. Estrada. For I tell you, we’re
going to govern that river!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Estrada’s pensive smile followed the dancing step of
the engineer until it carried him out of sight. Perhaps?
Because he was the son of his father, he must work as
hard as if conviction went with him, as if success waited
at the other end of the long road. But it was not going
to be. He would never see that river shackled—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A GARDEN IN A DESERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HIS dwelling leaped into sight as Hardin turned the
corner of the street. There was but one street running
through the twin towns, flanked by the ditches of
running water. The rest were ditches of running water
edged by foot-paths. Scowling, he passed under the
overhanging bird-cages of the Desert Hotel without a
greeting for the loungers, whose chairs were drawn up
against the shade of the brick walls. His abstraction
aborted the hallo of jovial Ben Petrie, who was leaving
his bank for his vineyard, the more congenial half of his
two-sided life. Petrie stood for a minute on the narrow
board-walk watching the hunched shoulders, the angry
blind progress. He shrugged. Hardin was sore. It
<i>was</i> pretty tough. Such infernal luck! He got thoughtfully
into his English trap.</p>

<p>Fred Eggers left his motley counter, and joined the
group of lounging Indians outside his store. He had a
morning paper in his hand. His pale blue eyes looked
surprised as Hardin’s momentum swept him past. “Mr.
Hardin,” he called ineffectually.</p>

<p>The momentum slackened as Hardin neared the place
he called his home. An inner tenderness diluted the
sneer that disfigured his face. He could see Innes as
she moved around in the little fenced-in strip that surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
her desert tent. She insisted on calling it a garden,
in spite of his raillery.</p>

<p>“Gerty’s in bed, I suppose,” thought Tom. He had a
sudden vivid picture of her accusing martyrdom. His
mouth hardened again. Innes, stooping over a rose,
passed out of his vision.</p>

<p>It came to Hardin suddenly that a man has made a
circle of failure when he dreads going to his office and
shrinks from the reproaches at home.</p>

<p>“A ‘has-been’ at forty!” he mused. Where were all
his ships drifting?</p>

<p>Innes, straightening, waved a gay hand.</p>

<p>“She’s raising a goodly crop of barrels.” His thought
mocked and caressed her. Her garden devotion was a
tender joke with him. He loved the Hardin trait in her,
the persistence which will not be daunted. An occupation
with a Hardin was a dedication. He would not
acknowledge the Innes blood in her. Like that fancy
mother of hers? Innes was a Hardin through and
through!</p>

<p>“It’s in the blood,” ran his thought. “She can’t help
it. All the Hardins work that way. The Hardins always
make fools of themselves!”</p>

<p>Innes, lifting her eyes from a crippled rose, saw that
the black devils were consuming him again.</p>

<p>“Will you look at this wreck!” she cried.</p>

<p>The wind-storm the previous week had made a sickening
devastation of her labors. The morning-glories alone
were scatheless. A pink oleander drooped many broken
branches from which miracles of perfect flowers were
unfolding. The prettiest blossom to Hardin was the
gardener herself. She was vivid from eager toil. Hardin
looked at her approbatively. He liked her khaki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
suit, simple as a uniform, with its flowing black tie and
leather belt. She looked more like herself to-day. She
had bleached out, in Tucson. She had been letting herself
get too tanned, running around without hats. Sunburn
paled the value of those splendid yellow eyes of
hers. He could always tease her by likening them to
topazes.</p>

<p>“Cat’s eyes, why don’t you say it?”</p>

<p>She pushed a teasing lock of hair out of her eyes with
one of her mud-splashed garden gloves. It left a ludicrous
smudge across her cheek.</p>

<p>“Each time I leave this garden,” she complained, “I
declare I won’t again. Not even for the Marshalls.”
She bent over again to adjust a bottomless keg around
a wind-whipped, moribund plant.</p>

<p>“Quite a keg plant!” he quizzed. “Raising anything
else?”</p>

<p>“And the glory of the morning he does not see!” she
exclaimed with theatric intent.</p>

<p>His eyes ran over the pink and purple lines of cord-trained
vines which made floral screens for her tent.
Free of the strings overhead, they rioted over the ramada,
the second roof, of living boughs. He acknowledged
their beauty. They gave grace to bare necessity;
they denied the panting, thirsty desert just beyond.</p>

<p>He remembered his own ramada. Gerty had hated it,
had complained of it so bitterly when she came home
from New York that he had had it pulled down and
replaced by a V roof of pine boards, glaring and ugly.
Gerty was satisfied, for it was clean; she no longer felt
that she lived in a squaw-house. Let the Indians have
ramadas; there was no earthly reason she should. He
had urged that the desert dwellers had valuable hints to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
give them. But what was a ramada to him, or anything
else?</p>

<p>He nodded at Innes.</p>

<p>“They are doing so much better than the ones you
planted at the office. I wonder if Sam doesn’t water
them enough?” His mood was faultfinding. “Didn’t
he water your roses while you were gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he <i>waters</i> enough,” smiled his sister. “But
Sam’s not for progress. He won’t see the difference between
watering and irrigating.”</p>

<p>“It looks like a train wreck, or a whipped prize-fighter,
next day,” observed Hardin.</p>

<p>“It’s really my fault. I staked it.” She was still
mourning over her calamity. “I forgot to barrel it.
Stakes won’t do here. The keg’s the thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they think in Mexicali.” Hardin turned
to leave.</p>

<p>“The joke’s as stale as their beer,” retorted Innes.
She did not want him to go so soon. She pointed out a
new vine to him. She had brought it from Tucson;
“Kudzu,” they called it; a Japanese vine. And there
was another broken rose, quite beyond the help of
stripped handkerchiefs and mesquit splints.</p>

<p>He followed her around the tent, her prattle falling
from his grim mood. He was not thinking of her flowers
except as a mocking parallel. The desert storm had
made a havoc of his garden—a sorry botch of his life.
He and Innes had been trying to make a garden out of
a desert; the desert had flouted them. It was not his
fault. Something had happened; something quite beyond
his power. Luck was turning against him.</p>

<p>Innes, why, she was playing as with a toy. It was the
natural instinct of a woman to make things pretty around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
her. But he had sacrificed his youth, his chances. His
domestic life, too—he should never have carried a dainty
little woman like Gerty into the desert. He had never
reproached her for leaving him, even last time when he
thought it was for good. The word burned his wound.
Whose good? His or Gerty’s? Somehow, though they
wrangled, he always knew it would turn out all right;
life would run smoothly when they left the desert. But
things were getting worse; his mouth puckered over some
recollections. Yet he loved Gerty; he couldn’t picture
life without her. He decided that it was because there
had never been any one else. Most fellows had had
sweethearts before they married; he had not, nor a mistress
when she left him, though God knows, it would
have been easy enough. His mouth fell into sardonic
lines. Those half-breed women! No one, even when a
divorce had hung over him. Oh, he knew what their
friends made of each of Gerty’s lengthened flights; he
knew! But that had been spared him, that vulgar grisly
spectacle of modern life when two people who have been
lovers drag the carcass of their love over the grimy
floor of a curious gaping court. He shuddered. Gerty
loved him. Else, why had she come back to him? Why
had she not kept her threat when he refused to abandon
his desert project and turn his abilities into a more profitable
dedication? He could see her face as she stared
flushing up into his that nipping cold day when he had
run into her on Broadway. He remembered her coquetry
when she suggested that there was plenty of room
in her apartment! His wife! She spoke of seeing his
pictures in the papers. “He had grown to be a great
man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>That piquant meeting, the week following had been
the brightest of his life. He was sure then that Gerty
loved him. The wrangles were only their different ways
of looking at things. Of course, they loved each other.
But Gerty couldn’t stand pioneer life. She had loved
him, or she would not so easily have been persuaded to
try it over again. She yearned to make him comfortable,
she said. So she had gone back, and pulled down his
ramada, and put his clothes in the lowest bureau drawer!</p>

<p>“It wasn’t either of our faults,” he ruminated. “It
was the fault of the institution. Marriage itself is a
failure. Look at the papers, the divorce courts. A man’s
interests are no longer his wife’s. Curious that it should
be so. But it’s a fact. It is the modern discontent.
Women want different careers from their husbands.”</p>

<p>Yet, how could he help throwing his life into his work?
He had committed himself; it was an obligation. Besides,
he was a Hardin; they take things that way. And, too,
a man can not live in the desert the best years, the vivid
years of his life without absorbing its grim indomitable
spirit; without learning to love, to require the great silent
mornings, the vast star-brilliance of the nights; without
falling under the spell of the land, the spell of elusiveness
and mystery, of false distances, illusions; of
content.</p>

<p>If it were not for that indefinable something, his allegiance
to the cause which mocked at reasons and definitions;
oh, he knew!—he had tilted with Gerty and been
worsted!—he would have resigned from the company,
his company which had dishonored him. Why should he
stay to get more stabs, more wounds? MacLean, what
in God’s name had MacLean ever done for the valley?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
And Rickard? It was he, Tom Hardin, who had pulled
the valley, and therefore the company, from ruin, and it
was that very act which had ruined him. Yet for his
life, were he to go over it again, he knew he could not
do differently. A curious twist of the ropes which had
pulled the company back from the edge of the precipice
and mangled him. Where was the loyalty of his associates?
Loyalty, there was no such thing! They were
cowards, all of them. Afraid of the power of the O. P.
Truckling to it! Kotowing to Marshall, shivering every
time he opened those profane lips of his. Bah! It
made his stomach turn. Oh, he saw through their reason
for kicking him out. He hadn’t been born yesterday.
This was a big thing, too big not to rouse cupidity, cupidity
of men and corporations. He had been fooled by
Marshall’s indifference; play, every bit of it; theatric.
Faraday’s reluctance? Sickening. It was a plot. Some
one had put him up to it, given him the first suggestion,
made him think it was his own. Hot chestnuts, all right!
He was burned all right, all right! And the last scorch,
this pet of Marshall’s! Hardin gave a scantling in his
path a vicious kick.</p>

<p>The girl’s prattle had died. She walked with him silently.</p>

<p>At the door of her tent, she stopped, looking at him
wistfully. She wished he could hide his hurt. If he
had only some of the Innes’ pride!</p>

<p>“How are things?” She used their fond little formula.</p>

<p>“Oh, rotten!” growled Hardin, flinging away. The
gate slammed behind him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>UNDER THE VENEER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AN hour later Innes, blinking from the sun, stepped
into the tent, which had been partitioned with rough
redwood boards into a bed-chamber on the right, a combination
dining-room and “parlor” on the left. Her
glance immediately segregated the three stalks of pink
geraniums in the center of the Mexican drawn-work cloth
that covered the table. Gerty, herself, in a fresh pink
gingham frock, was dancing around the table to the tune
of forks and spoons. It was just like Gerty to dress up
to her setting, even though it were only a pitiful water-starved
bouquet. She had often tried to analyze her
sister-in-law’s hold on her brother; certainly they were
not happy. Was it because she made him comfortable?
Was it the little air of formality, or mystery, which she
drew around her? Her rooms when Innes was allowed
to enter them were always flawless; Gerty took deep
pride in her housekeeping. Why was it, Innes wondered,
that she could never shake off her suspicion of an underlying
untidiness? There was always a closed door on
Gerty’s processes.</p>

<p>“May I help?” The sun was still yellowing the room
to her.</p>

<p>“Hello!” Hardin looked up from the couch where he
was lying. Innes suspected it of being a frequent retreat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
She had found it tumbled once when she ran over early.
It was then that Gerty made it understood that she liked
more formality. Innes was rarely in that tent except for
meals now, or during her alternating week of house-chores.</p>

<p>“I was afraid I was late,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Lunch will be ready in a few minutes,” announced
Gerty Hardin. “Won’t you sit down? There’s the new
<i>Journal</i>. Sam came to clean this morning, and I couldn’t
get to the lunch until an hour ago.”</p>

<p>Innes, settling herself by the reading table, caught herself
observing that it would not have taken her an hour
to get a cold lunch. Still, it would never look so inviting!
If Gerty’s domestic machinery was complicated
and private, the results always were admirable. The
early tomatoes were peeled as well as sliced, and were
lying on a bed of cracked ice. The ripe black olives
were resting in a lake of California olive oil. A bowl of
crisp lettuce had been iced and carefully dried. The
bread was cut in precise triangles; the butter had been
shaved into foreign-looking roses. A pitcher of the valley’s
favorite beverage, iced tea, stood by Hardin’s plate.
There was a platter of cold meats.</p>

<p>It came home to Innes for the hundredth time, the surprise
of such a meal in that desert. A few years ago,
and what had a meal been? She threw the credit of the
little lunch to sulky Tom Hardin lying on the portière-covered
couch, his ugly lower lip outthrust against an
unsmiling vision. It was Tom, Tom and his brave men,
the sturdy engineers, the dauntless surveyors, the Indians
who had dug the canals, those were the ones who
had spread that pretty table, not the buxom little woman
darting about in pink gingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Is it because I don’t like her?” she mused, her eyes
on the pictures in the style-book which had just come in
that morning. Certainly Gerty did have the patience of
a saint with Tom’s humors. If she would only lose that
set look of martyrdom! It was not for an outsider to
judge between a husband and wife, even if the man were
her own brother. She could not put her finger on the
germ of their painful scenes; she shrank from the recollection
of Tom’s temper; his coarse streak, the Gingg
fiber, her own mother had called it. Tom was rough,
but she loved him. Why was it she was sure that Gerty
did not love her husband? Yet there was the distrust,
as fixed and as unjust perhaps as the suspicion of Gerty’s
little mysteries.</p>

<p>She said aloud: “This is your last day. My week begins
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin adjusted a precise napkin before she
spoke.</p>

<p>“I think I will keep the reins for a month this time.”
Her words were reflective, as though the thought were
new. “I get my hand in just as I stop. I will be running
out for my visit in a few weeks. It will be only
fair for me to do it as long as I can.”</p>

<p>Again the girl had a sense of subtlety. Whenever
Gerty put on that air of childish confidential deliberation,
she hunted for the plot. This was not far to seek.
Her sister-in-law was passing out the hot season to her.</p>

<p>“It’s all ready.” Gerty’s glance was winging, bird-like,
over the table. Nothing had been forgotten. She gave
a little sigh of esthetic satisfaction. Hardin misinterpreted
it.</p>

<p>“I ought to be able to keep a servant for her.” It was
like him to have forgotten the Lawrence days; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
never free of the sense of obligation to the dainty little
woman who was born, he felt, for the purple. There
was nothing too good for Gerty. He felt her unspoken
disappointments; her deprivations. “Of course, she can
have no respect for me. I’m a failure.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t this give you an appetite?” demanded Innes
heartily. “And I’m to be a lady for three more weeks.”
The remark was thoughtless. A bright flush spread over
Gerty’s face. She caught an allusion to her origin.</p>

<p>Innes saw the blush and remembered the boarding-house.
She could think of nothing to say. The three
relatives sat down to that most uncomfortable travesty,
a social meal where sociability is lacking. Innes said it
had been a pleasant morning. Gerty thought it had been
hot. And then there was silence again.</p>

<p>Innes began to tell them of her Tucson visit, when
Gerty laid down her fork. “I’ve meant to ask you a
hundred times. Did you attend to my commission in
Los Angeles?”</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you. I raked the town, really I did,
Gerty.” For there was a cloud on Gerty’s pretty brow.
“I could have got you the other kind, but you said you
did not want it.”</p>

<p>“I should think not.” The childish chin was lifted.
“Those complicated things are always getting out of
order. Besides, if I had an adjustable form, everybody’d
be borrowing it.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” demanded Tom, waking
up. “Who’d borrow your what, Gert?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t call me Gert, Tom,” besought his wife
plaintively. “A figure. I wanted Innes to try to get one
for me in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“I did try,” began Innes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Yours is good enough for any one. Why should you
get another?” He was openly admiring the ample bust
swelling under the pink gingham.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Tom.”</p>

<p>Innes tried to explain the sincerity of her search. She
had visited every store “which might be suspected of having
a figure.” She could not bring a smile to her sister’s
face. “There was none your size. They offered to order
one from Chicago. They have to be made to order,
if they are special sizes. You are not stock size, did you
know that?”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” cried Gerty, bridling. “My waist
is absurdly small for the size of my hips and shoulders.”</p>

<p>Innes wondered if it would be safe to agree with her.</p>

<p>“When will it be here?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be disappointed.” Innes found herself stammering.
“But not for six weeks. I did not know
whether to order it or not.”</p>

<p>“And I in Los Angeles with my summer sewing all
done! What good will it do me then?” The pretty eyes
looked ready for childish tears.</p>

<p>“I know. That is, I <i>didn’t</i> know what to do,” apologized
Innes Hardin. “I decided to order it as I’d found
the place, and was right there, but I made sure that I
could countermand the order by telegram. So I can this
very afternoon. I knew you would be disappointed. I
was sorry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll need it next winter,” admitted Gerty, helping herself
to some of the chilled tomatoes. “I’m sure I’m
much obliged to you. I hope it did not put you to much
trouble.”</p>

<p>The words raised the wall of formality again. Innes
bent over her plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“What made you change your plans?” suddenly demanded
his wife of Hardin. “When Sam came in with
your bag, he surprised me so.”</p>

<p>“My boss kept me.” Hardin’s face looked coarse,
roughened by his ugly passion. “Rickard, your old
friend. He served a subpœna on me at the station.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Gerty. “Surely, he did not do that, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Sure he did.” Hardin’s face was black with his evil
mood. “I’m only an underling, a disgraced underling.
He’s my boss. He’s going to make me remember it.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say such things,” pouted his wife. “If
it does not hurt you, if you do not care, think how I
must feel—”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” exclaimed Hardin. The veneer was rubbed
down to the rough wood. Innes saw the coarseness her
mother had complained of, the Gingg fiber.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think I like to take orders, to jump at
the snap of the whip?” He was deliberately beating up
his anger into a froth. “Oh, sure, I do. That’s a Hardin,
through and through.”</p>

<p>Again the angry blood flooded his wife’s cheeks. He,
too, was throwing the boarding-house at her.</p>

<p>“You did it yourself.” Gerty with difficulty was withholding
the angry tears. “I told you how it would be.
You would do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” cried Tom, pushing back his plate.</p>

<p>His sister looked drearily out the wire-screened door.
Her view was a dusty street. Hardin got up, scraping
his chair over the board floor.</p>

<p>“And to keep it from me,” persisted the wife. “To let
me ask him to dinner—”</p>

<p>“Does that dismal farce have to go on?” demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Hardin, turning back to the table. “You’ll have to have
it without me, then. I’ll not stay and make a fool of
myself. Ask him to dinner. Me! I’ll see myself.”</p>

<p>Innes wished she were in the neighboring tent. Tom
was lashing himself into a coarse fury.</p>

<p>To her dismay, Gerty burst into tears. It was killing
her, the disgrace, she cried. She couldn’t endure it.
She couldn’t stand it there; she had not the courage to
go to Los Angeles, where her friends would pity her.
It was crushing her. <i>She</i> was not a Hardin; <i>she</i> was
sensitive; she could not justify everything a Hardin did
as right, no matter what the consequences. The pretty
eyes obscured, she rushed, a streaming Niobe, from the
room.</p>

<p>The brother and sister avoided each other’s eyes.
Innes rose and cleared the table of the dishes. She made
a loud noise with the running water in the shed, racketing
the pans to drown the insistence of Gerty’s sobbing.</p>

<p>She kept listening for Tom’s step. She wanted to go
with him when he left; he must not reach the office in
the blackness of that mood. She wished he would not
betray his feelings; yet she knew it was not he who was
to blame.</p>

<p>When she heard the screen door slam, she flashed out
the back way.</p>

<p>“Going?” she called after him. “Wait for me.” She
dashed into her tent for her hat. She had to run to
catch up with him.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d go and see Mrs. Parrish,” she caught
up, panting. “I’ve not seen her since I came back, and
I felt anxious. Have you heard how she was?”</p>

<p>“A man’s a fool who’ll bring in a nervous silly woman
like that,” growled Hardin, stalking along. “Any man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
a fool,” he added to himself, “who expects to keep the
love or the respect of a woman in a place like this.
Women want luxury, modern women. They can’t stand
hardships.” He was a fool, like Parrish.</p>

<p>“Any of the rigs going over in that direction to-day?”
inquired his sister. She told herself that if Gerty had
made that conversational opening, she would have convicted
her of tactlessness. The Parrish theme was certainly
an inspired one!</p>

<p>“I should send MacLean over to the Wistaria. Those
Indians shirk if we don’t jump in on them every day.”
Then his face blackened again. “I was going to send
the new machine. But I suppose the boss will be using it.”</p>

<p>All topics were equally dangerous with Tom in this
mood!</p>

<p>The telegraph operator told Hardin that Rickard had
gone to Imperial with MacLean.</p>

<p>“Truckling,” sneered Hardin, thrusting out his lip.</p>

<p>Innes felt a thud of anger.</p>

<p>“Wish he could stand a hurt like an Innes,” she
thought.</p>

<p>“A toady,” concluded Tom. “How do you like your
new boss, boys?” The men crowded around him. Innes,
through an open window, saw MacLean, Jr., in the company’s
new machine, leaving the sheds. She ran out of
the office.</p>

<p>“I won’t listen to you,” she defied her disloyal
thoughts. “He’s my brother. I’ll not listen to you.”</p>

<p>A wide-open smile was on MacLean’s face as he swung
the long gray machine around to the morning-glories.</p>

<p>“Coming to Wistaria? Oh, that’s bully.”</p>

<small>ON THE WISTARIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOU are sure you are feeling better?” insisted
Innes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish’s answer was careful. She <i>thought</i> she
was feeling better! She had not had one of those bad
nervous headaches for a week. “It was a week come
Sunday, no, it was more than that, it was of a Saturday
when the last bad spell came on. It was one of those
hot days, the second of the three, you remember; oh,
but you were in Tucson. Did you get to Los Angeles?”
Her sigh was almost ecstatic. “Los Angeles is nice. I
haven’t been there for two years come September.”</p>

<p>“You surely will go out this summer?” The hectic
color, the snapping restlessness of her hostess’ black eyes
disquieted the girl.</p>

<p>“I’ve not decided,” evaded Mrs. Parrish. “Oh, I’m
all right! That last medicine I got from Los Angeles
helped me a lot. As I was saying, it was that hot Saturday,
and I had my baking to do. I can’t cook on Sunday;
Jim hates to see me working; I have to get at it
when he’s out of the way. I think the oil must have been
bad; I don’t know what Coulter was thinking of—I
always insist on paying for the best; the cheap sort will
smell. Maybe, it wasn’t the oil, but by noon I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
hardly see. I sent back that can, and had them send out
new wicks—it’s a blue-flame stove I use—but of course
that didn’t cure the headache. And the cooking not done.”</p>

<p>Innes suggested that there were two cooks in that
family! Everybody knew that Jim Parrish had developed,
through the exigency of desert conditions and his
wife’s headaches, into the most helpful of cooks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish smiled with sad pride. “He’s had to do
it too much. He’s too good to me, Jim is.” She was
wishing she had not been grinding coffee in the lean-to
when Miss Hardin came. The automobile was on her
before she had time to get away, and Miss Hardin speaking
to her through the screening. With the old purple
flannelette waist on! She had put it on that morning
for “the last time.” She hoped Miss Hardin would not
notice the missing buttons. She stretched a torn and
faded apron of gingham that had once been brown
across her knees. She did not dare take it off. She had
put on, too, her old blue alpaca skirt, promising herself
that she would use it for rags, tear it up before she could
ever yield to the temptation of wearing it again. She
looked like a slouch, she knew; and her hands fidgeted
over the deficiencies of her dress. The desert was excuse
enough! The washing had to be sent out of the
valley, or it had to be done by one’s self, the water boiled
niggardly on a blue-flame stove. She had good things
to wear, but she could see down the road a long way,
and visitors were scarce; she could sight them a mile
off, and get into clean clothes and be sitting waiting in
the tent parlor when the folk drove up. But the new
automobile of the company, seen for the first time,
changed that. A puff, a rumble, and there it was upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
her, with Miss Hardin smiling at her through the screen
window!</p>

<p>“Washing or no washing, I’ll have to keep ready to
see folks,” she resolved. She tried to make the hand
look casual that was holding the rebellious waist together
over her meager bust.</p>

<p>“It’s been cool since I got home,” cheered Innes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish hoped that Miss Hardin could not see
behind the rough screen into the space that was called
a bedroom. The bed was tossed and tumbled; the night
clothes lying around. And she had not washed last
week. “I’d be ashamed to have her see those clothes,”
she thought. “Take this chair, Miss Hardin,” she begged.
“It’s more comfortable.” Innes asked to be allowed to
stay where she was, but she had to surrender to the
other’s nervous persistence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish kept her hand over her gaping placket
as she made the change. “Yes, it’s been cool,” she answered,
“but, oh, the wind! Ain’t it terrible? They say
as these tents won’t blow down, they are so well put together.
Do you believe it, Miss Hardin? That the
‘spider’ coming down so low shelters it so that it couldn’t
blow over?”</p>

<p>“Of course they won’t blow over!” chirped Innes
Hardin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish sighed. “That’s what Jim says. I wish
I could believe it. I’m not doubting you, or him, neither,
Miss Hardin; I know you mean what you say. But when
the wind blows, and the tent creaks, and strains, oh, I
know then as it’s coming down; I can’t sleep those windy
nights. I just lie and plan which way I’ll jump when it
goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Innes tried to laugh at her, but the woman’s fear was
too real.</p>

<p>“I’ve made myself learn to love the wind,” she urged.
“Don’t you think you could, too? Try to think of it as
gay; as the air of the world on some mad, reckless romp.
It gets into your blood, then, and you want to run, to
dance. ‘Oh, the whole world is glad of the wind!’”</p>

<p>“The wind in Nebraska’s like that, but this! Why, it
sounds like angry devils to me, all shrieking to me to get
out; that I don’t belong here. I cover up my ears with
the bedclothes, but it’s no use. I can hear them just the
same: ‘I’ll blow you away. I’ll blow you away.’ And
then the dust it brings; the dirt! There’s no use trying
to be clean.” The mouth muscles twitched unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“How is the neuralgia?” inquired Innes, helpless
against this determined pessimism.</p>

<p>“Better. That new medicine is helping that. I seemed
to wear out the good effects of those powders.”</p>

<p>“Have you begun to sleep out-of-doors yet?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish shivered. “I wouldn’t sleep a wink. I’d
be waiting for Indians all night.”</p>

<p>“The Indians are harmless,” cried Innes. “They
wouldn’t hurt any one.”</p>

<p>“They’re Indians!” persisted Mrs. Parrish. “I’ll never
get over being afraid of their dark faces. They’re
heathens.”</p>

<p>Innes turned her eyes hopelessly away from the woman’s
twitching face. She looked out the wire-meshed
door beyond the line of stakes which stood for the proposed
canal. She wondered when MacLean, Jr., would
be coming back for her.</p>

<p>“Is that a company rig?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I declare if it isn’t the Busby wagon!” exclaimed Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Parrish, jumping up and going to the door. Her dress
threatened to leave her. “She’s driving the roans.
There’s somebody with her. It must be Mr. Busby!”</p>

<p>The wretched room was then fully revealed to the
guest. There was a rent in the loud-patterned couch
cover of green and red; the table cover, a fringed imitation
damask, was askew. Disorder leaped from beneath
the couch, from the boxes by the door, from the room
beyond. A graphophone perched uncertainly on the edge
of the table. A pile of <i>Youth’s Companions</i> toppled uncertainly
away over a pine box. There were a few pictures
from <i>Life</i> tacked upon the board walls; a few
were pasted to the canvas top-walls. Innes segregated
the two influences. The graphophone, the file of <i>Youth’s
Companions</i>, the pictures from <i>Life</i>, these were the contributions
of Jim Parrish toward the elevating of their
sordid life. The dirt, the disorder made up no less a
heroic subscription from the wife, who was too frail for
the sacrifice, too fond and too proud for a surrender.</p>

<p>“How can you see so far?” Innes asked. “I thought I
could see farther than most people, but this glare blinds
me.”</p>

<p>“If you lived over here in Number Six, miles off from
everybody, with nobody to see, unless it’s the engineers
or those black Indians, you’d learn to know folks miles
off. It’s—yes, it is Mr. Busby. He’s been promising to
bring her over here to sit with me the first time he came
to inspect the Wistaria. It’s to come right past here
when it’s finished. I’ll be seeing folks then. But I
shouldn’t complain of not having visitors. Two in one
day!”</p>

<p>To Innes Hardin the excitement seemed all out of proportion
to the cause. Dark somber blotches were coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
out on the woman’s skin. “Sit down. It’s too warm for
you by the door.”</p>

<p>“They might go past,” began Mrs. Parrish, when a
smell of burning food smote both their nostrils. “The
rice and codfish’s burning,” she exclaimed, and fled to
the kitchen in the lean-to.</p>

<p>She was not back in time to greet her guest, whose
vigorous entrance struck at once the note of middle-aged,
experienced authority. Innes had met her but once before,
but she recognized the species, the woman who has
the best recipe for bread, the most valuable hints for
housekeepers; handy in the sick room, indispensable at
accouchements; a kindly irresistible vulture.</p>

<p>Their talk was of the coming heat, the new canal; the
difference it would make to “Number Six”; the melon
crop.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish came fluttering back, her brown apron
changed for a clean white one. A few pins sealed the
gap in the unutterable purple waist. She could not get
another without passing through the sitting-room, and
she had a feeling of shame to emphasize her embarrassment
before Miss Hardin. Her cheeks were redder, her
eyes more glittering.</p>

<p>She established Mrs. Busby on the wire-collapsible
couch, with the green and red flowered cover. The
guest preferred a straight chair, but Mrs. Parrish would
not hear of it. She herself had a rocker. Perched on
one edge of it, she rocked back and forth violently, until
her chair kept grating against Innes’. The girl pitied the
woman’s excitement, wondering at it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish was worked up to almost hysterical sociability.
It was as if a deep desert well had been tapped.
Her rocker swaying interminably, she told them of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
life at home, of the farm they were just clearing of the
mortgage; of her love for Nebraska. She would never
forget that day when a friend, they wouldn’t know him,
but it was Sam Kirkland, anyway! when he came through
on his way back East to get his family. He told the
wonderful story of the Imperial Valley—of the country
below sea-level, where even cactus would not grow. To
their skeptical ears he had unfolded a tale of rich soils,
of desert redemption—of irrigation “which made Jim
Parrish just sit up, I can tell you.” The early crops, the
water scientifically applied, the hothouse heat, the millions
in sight. Was he, Sam Kirkland goin’ back? Well,
sure. He was no man’s fool. He knew opportunity
when he saw it.</p>

<p>And then the pamphlets! When they began to come
she fell to watching her Jim uneasily. All their friends
were in Nebraska; and her doctor. “Let well enough
alone,” says I. “How can I live without Doctor Pratt,
who knows all my symptoms? But Jim just would
come!” She related the weary minute details of their
home-breaking; of their move from Nebraska. Her impressions
of California, deeply registered, were passed
on to her guests. Her horror of the valley. Her fear
of the Indians—her fear of the wind, of centipedes, and
she knew that the water was typhoidal—</p>

<p>“Typhoidal? Bosh!” interjected Maria Busby. She
had something to say about the water, but she could not
get it in. The rocker grew more agitated. “The very
rocker which had been brought in on a wagon from Old
Beach! That was before the railroad came in; every
one had to wagon it from Old Beach. But that was before
their time!</p>

<p>“I don’t sleep. That’s the trouble with me,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
jumped back to her ailments, her nervous eyes passing
from Mrs. Busby’s face to Innes Hardin’s. “Jim calls
me the desert watch-dog. I feel as I must keep an ear
and eye trained on the desert to see what it’s going to do
next; or the river; or the Indians.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby thought she saw a chance to talk of the
water, and why it was not typhoidal. But she was not
swift enough. Innes was cheered to hear the chug of
the company automobile. Before another stream of talk
started on its irresistible flow, she made her escape.
Through the screen door, as she was borne away, she
could see Mrs. Parrish, still wildly rocking.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>FEAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. Parrish’s chair continued to plunge. It rocked
and pitched like a ship in a storm. Her tongue
gathered excitement from the motion. Mrs. Busby looked
with anxiety at the graphophone perching uncertainly on
the pine box. The curved rocker was threatening it.
Mrs. Parrish drew back, and the danger was once again
averted. She was plowing her way now toward the
wire couch covered with the red and green tapestry
ordered from a circular from Howe and Wort’s, Chicago.
Mrs. Busby, usually placid, caught a little of the excitement.
If she had nerves she told herself, she would be
turned crazy. As it was, nerveless, and poised by the
support of a newly acquired philosophy, she watched,
hypnotized, the menace of that desperate rocker. Two
lurid spots glowed in the cheeks of her hostess. The excitement
of hostess-ship was consuming her. Entertaining,
in simple folk vocabulary, means talking. So Mrs.
Parrish talked.</p>

<p>When her ailments were exhausted, she began on her
neighbors’. Mrs. Busby caught her breath as the rocker
jabbed the pine box carrying the talking-machine. “I
wonder why she wants a talking-machine?” she asked
herself with the grim humor which had won sturdy Sam
Busby twenty years before when he had acquired the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
habit of buying bread at the Home Bakery in a suburb
of Boston where Maria Mathes served.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish was embarked now on the sea of a
neighbor’s woe, the rocker working toward the couch. A
newcomer into the valley, Mrs. Dowker, was the subject
of another Æneid. It transpired that Mr. Dowker had
been reading desert literature, too. He had heard of
wonderful cures effected by desert air. He dreamed to
make a fortune and recreate a sickly wife. Mrs. Dowker
from a hospital bed begged to be left behind for a year.
Mrs. Parrish dwelt on the Dowker pilgrimage with
ghoulish realism. Mrs. Dowker was failing under the
labors of desert life; the little boy was always ailing. It
was hard to get bottled water “in there.” Mrs. Dowker
had to boil every drop they drank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby saw her chance and grabbed it. “I don’t
believe in boiled water,” she announced. Mrs. Parrish
was ready to pick up her thread, but Mrs. Busby was
not to be ousted.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in all this fuss about bottled water, nor
in boiled water, either. The water of a place is the water
one should drink. You breathe the air, why shouldn’t
you drink the water?” Her logic was terrifically convincing
to herself. “To be consistent, why shouldn’t you
bring in bottled air? The water of a place is the water
that agrees with one in that place. Why, that’s as plain
as poverty! Look at the Indians. They’ve been drinking
this water for a hundred years, and over. Did you
ever hear of an Indian dying because he drank too much
water?” It was a touch of the Maria Mathes sardonic
humor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby quoted Mrs. Hadley. “Didn’t every one
scare her into thinking that the canal water was not fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to drink, and didn’t she boil every drop that went down
a Hadley throat?”</p>

<p>“But that was different,” tried to interpose Mrs. Parrish,
but Mrs. Busby held the rostrum.</p>

<p>“And that first year, wasn’t the three of them, herself
and her two grown sons, down with typhoid? Where’d
they get it? Out of the air? You can’t talk to me of
boiled water.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it was the boiled water that killed Joe
Hadley?” demanded Mrs. Parrish, fear reducing her
black eyes to points of startled light.</p>

<p>“There’s the facts,” said her guest with an oracular
wave of the hand. “Take ’em, or leave ’em.” And then
she practised passing on her second lesson. “It was the
<i>fear</i> of the water as killed them. That’s my belief.”</p>

<p>“Fear?”</p>

<p>“Fear,” declaimed Mrs. Busby, rising out of reach of
the suspended rocker, and taking the Morris chair deserted
by Innes Hardin. “Fear is <i>poison</i>.” She watched
the effect of her words, for a careful second. She had no
intention of being entertained any more!</p>

<p>She answered the round question in Mrs. Parrish’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m only just beginning it—I see it as plain as prophecy,
but it’s hard to explain. The fear of a thing gives
you a thing itself. There is no such thing as pain.” A
loud protest from Mrs. Parrish warned her into guarding
her outposts. “There is no such thing as pain. It
is only <i>fear</i> of the pain which gives it to you. It is so
clear to me; I wish I could explain it. But I’ve some
pamphlets; I’ll send them over by Sam, the next time
he comes over to the Wistaria. This new canal ought
to be helping you over here,” she hazarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I heard as you were taking that up, the new
thoughts,” Mrs. Parrish returned to the main issue. “Is
that a part of it?”</p>

<p>“Fear? you mean. Have you never thought yourself
into a toothache?”</p>

<p>Parrish toothache had been too recent to be imaginary.
“It’s decay, usually, with me,” she faltered. “Decay,
and then the nerves get exposed. Mine die easily. I just
lie awake sometimes, all night, dreading as one of my
nerves will die, and with no good dentist this side of Los
Angeles.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you so?” Mrs. Busby thrilled over this
unexpected ally. “Well, if you agree that you can think
yourself into a pain, can’t you think yourself out of it?
It must work both ways. That’s logic.”</p>

<p>“Not a toothache.” The black beady eyes, shut obstinately
over their conviction. “That’s real. Perhaps
you never had one?”</p>

<p>“Not since I’ve begun to study. And besides, they’re
false. They’re not mine, the teeth, I mean. Didn’t you
never guess it? Pretty good work, I tell Sam. They fool
every one. He put in two large gold fillings in the front
teeth, so as they’d look just like the ones I lost. There’s
Sam coming now. I promised I’d not keep him waitin’.
I’ll send you those leaflets. And I’ll come out and explain
them some day. But I’m busy now, getting ready
for the hot weather. Goin’ out this year?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrish thought not.</p>

<p>Sam Busby shouted through the door that he was in
a hurry; that he had to leave her at home, and get out
to Grant’s Heading. There was trouble there. A messenger
had just caught him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby’s farewell to Mrs. Parrish had to be casual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
She clambered up into the seat beside her short stubby
master. Sam had a short blackened pipe between his
teeth, obviously his own. No store or dentist would acknowledge
them. His sombrero, battered and sunburned,
was pulled low over his jolly blue eyes.</p>

<p>She opened a large black cotton umbrella.</p>

<p>“She’ll never grasp it,” she was thinking aloud.</p>

<p>“Grasp what?” the humorous eyes turned toward her.</p>

<p>“The new thoughts. If I could only get her to throw
away that shelf of medicines.”</p>

<p>“Now, for the lord’s sake, don’t go proselyting,
Maria.”</p>

<p>“How can I, when I haven’t learned to hold a thought
yet, myself?”</p>

<p>“Hold a—what? Whatever you are talking about?”</p>

<p>“You hold a good thought—it’s like the Catholics
crossing themselves with holy water, only it isn’t. It
keeps off bad thoughts—trouble. It sounds easy, but it’s
terribly hard.”</p>

<p>“Jew Peter!”</p>

<p>She mistook his exclamation. “Well, you just try it
yourself. Sometime, when you’re just a-dyin’ for a
smoke, just you hold the thought that you are smokin’,
and see if it’s easy.”</p>

<p>He looked at her a few minutes reflectively before
speaking. Was Maria losing all her humor? He had
been noticing a tendency to dictate, a growing dogmatism.
Jew Peter! Like her mother! How he had dreaded the
corpulent and dogmatic Mrs. Mathes, whom he had
learned to respect at a distance, a very complete distance!
He had loved Maria not only for herself, but for the
dissimilarity to her mother. Come to think of it, matronhood,
middle-aged matronhood, brought dictatorial authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
with the dreaded double chin. On every hand,
one sees young girls and gaiety. Does the gaiety go with
the girlhood? He stole a distrustful look at Mrs. Busby.
He had not heard her laugh or crack a joke for a long
while. He felt cheated, as though he had bought a piece
of goods that did not wear well.</p>

<p>“Maria Busby,” he said solemnly, “when it’s time
for me to take to holdin’ thoughts, it’ll be time for me to
quit holdin’ anything. Now, what I’ve always liked
about you was that you were not eternally meddlin’ and
fussin’ like other men’s wives. You’ve minded your own
business. That’s what I liked. Keep to it. I don’t care
what new fad you pick up. Pick ’em all up. Only don’t
force ’em down other folks’ throats. That’s what I could
never understand in women. They can never do anything
alone. If they find a new medicine, they’ve got to
make some one else try it. They love company so much
that they want to carry some one along to the other side
if the drug happens to be fatal. That’s all I can make
out of it.”</p>

<p>“Sam,” Mrs. Busby’s voice was tremulously earnest,
“this is so wonderful. You aren’t willing to let me help
you with it?”</p>

<p>“Am I needin’ help?” His sturdy rotund body deflected
her missionary zeal for an instant.</p>

<p>“You might be sick.” She yearned to protect his unguarded
body with the shining wonderful armor she had
discovered. She could not be happy in this new religion
with her Sam stalking alone outside in the black terrors
of the night. She began to realize why religion demands
its martyrs. She sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Feelin’ poorly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I’m all right. It’s you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Oh, I’m poorly, am I? Well, if this is feelin’ poorly,
I’d be afraid to feel well. Something would bust.” He
shook such a vigorous repudiation that the mares took it
as a command, and several miles had flown past before
he had them calmed.</p>

<p>“Frightened?” He threw the word over his shoulder
to a disheveled Maria Busby, clinging to her bonnet.
The mares were still quivering.</p>

<p>Through white lips, Mrs. Busby murmured that she
was all right, now!</p>

<p>“What’s that you were tryin’ to tell me a way back?”
he asked when the mares had settled down into a sober
gait.</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as pain,” began Mrs. Busby.
She must always begin there. It was the initial letter of
her creed.</p>

<p>“I thought you said something about not having fear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew I couldn’t explain it to you, you’re such a
mocker, Sam Busby. But I’ve got books for you to read.
They’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“It’s not another sort of Electropoise?” grinned her
spouse. “Do you remember, Maria, how you used to
have me sittin’ there, one end of that infernal machine
in a pail of water, the other tied around my leg, keep
me sittin’ like a fool waitin’ for currents. Nary a current,
or a raison Paddy would say. Holy smoke!”</p>

<p>She held up a solemn finger. “See that?”</p>

<p>“Anything the matter? Another felon?”</p>

<p>“I can think a pain in that finger.”</p>

<p>“Why should you?”</p>

<p>His levity threw her argument off the track. She had
planned a physical, scientific proof. How by taking
thought, she could gather the blood at a stated point;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
how congestion would inevitably follow. The sequence
evaded her.</p>

<p>“I thought there was no such thing as pain?”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to trap me. Just listen. If I can think a
pain there, why can’t I think it away?” The sequence
came to her. “See, I think the blood to the tip of my
finger. It congests. There is inflammation; a swellin’.”</p>

<p>“Does it hurt much?” She saw a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>The two drove on in silence, busy with the thoughts
which must divide them. Sam decided that Maria had
parted with her charm, her sense of fun. And then he
gave himself up to his routine. Baldwin’s alfalfa was
fine this spring. If the railroad could handle it, what a
crop of melons the valley would harvest that year!
There was a stoppage in the canal. The water looked
stagnant. He forgot Maria.</p>

<p>She was facing a noble lonely martyrdom. This truth
which was being revealed to her, which was dawning
above her sky as a wonderful shimmer of light, she must
follow where it led. Sam’s obstinacy would keep him
out. No, they would not bicker; she was above that. She
never quarreled with any one. It must be a closed subject
between them; their first barrier. She felt very
righteous and holy. He stopped at their house, a square
pine cottage, built by jovial Sam Busby, and bossed by
Maria.</p>

<p>As he was driving through the pine-board gate, he
pulled the gray mares on their startled haunches. Real
concern was in his honest face.</p>

<p>“Sure nothing’s the matter with that finger, Maria?”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” tossed Maria Busby.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE RIVALS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM the window of the adobe office building of the
company, Hardin saw Rickard jump from the rear
platform of the train as it slowed into the station. He
noticed that the new manager carried no bag.</p>

<p>“Wonder what he’s decided to do about the head-gate.
He didn’t waste much time out there.” Hardin was
fidgeting in his seat, his eyes on the approaching figure.
His desk was cluttered with untouched papers; there was
a report to be made; Hardin had several times made a
great show of getting out his books, sharpening his pencils,
but he was as restless as a girl when a lover’s declaration
lingers. Marshall had held up the gate—what
did Marshall know about it, he’d like to know, sitting at
his office desk in Tucson? They were losing valuable
time. He wondered what Rickard would report to his
chief; he vowed to himself that he would not show his
eagerness by inquiring. “Ask him, please him by truckling?
I’d see the gate rot first.”</p>

<p>Rickard passed through the room, nodding to his
office force. The door of the inner office shut behind
him. Hardin stared at the blank surface. He moved
restlessly in his swivel chair. Did the fellow think a big
thing like that could hang on while he unpacked his
trunks and settled his bureau drawers? He picked up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
pencil, jabbing at the paper of his report. He covered
the sheet with figures—three hundred—six hundred. Six
hundred feet. Whose fault that the intake had widened,
doubling its width, trebling its problem? Whose but
Marshall’s, who had sent down one of his office clerks to
see what Hardin was doing? Wouldn’t any man in his
senses know that the way Maitland would distinguish
himself would be by discrediting Hardin, by throwing
bouquets to Marshall; praising <i>his</i> plan? They all go
at it the same sickening way! Office clerks, bah! Sure,
Maitland had advised against the completion of the gate.
Said it would cost more in time and money than Hardin’s
estimates. “Thanks to Maitland it did,” growled Hardin,
scrawling figures over the page. “By the time Maitland
finished monkeying with that toy dam of his the river had
widened the break from three hundred to six hundred
feet. For that, they throw mud at me. Oh, it makes me
sick.” Hardin flung his broken pencil out of the window.</p>

<p>Rickard reentered the room. The question leaped
from Hardin.</p>

<p>“The head-gate—are you going on with it?”</p>

<p>Rickard looked curiously at the flushed antagonistic
face of the man he had supplanted. The thought crossed
his mind that perhaps Hardin had taken to drinking. It
made his answer curt.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know!”</p>

<p>“I have no report to make, Mr. Hardin, until I see the
gate.”</p>

<p>“And you went to the Crossing without going down
to the head-gate?” Hardin did not try to conceal his disgust.</p>

<p>“I did not go to the Crossing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Didn’t go—!” Hardin’s mouth was agape. Then
he rudely swiveled his chair. The door slammed behind
Rickard.</p>

<p>Hadn’t been to the Crossing? Then where in Hades
did he go? “Truckling to MacLean! Those office clerks!
I know them. Jumping for favors from the man higher
up.” He ticked off on his fingers the days the new manager
had already squandered. Saturday, he threw in
perversely the day of Rickard’s arrival, Saturday, Sunday,
he loafed all day Sunday, Monday—and this was
Wednesday. What could a man find in the valley to do
if he didn’t rush straight to the gate? The gate upon
which the whole valley hung? Gerty’s dinner occurred
to him. “He never intended to come,” he reflected with
satisfaction. “He’ll have to be starting for the Heading
to-morrow. Already, it’s a farce, five days!”</p>

<p>He halted MacLean who was passing him, a stenographic
pad under his arm, a battered copy of <i>Thorns
and Orange Blossoms</i> in his hand. He was cramming
night and day, requisitioning the good-natured to read
aloud at a snail’s pace. He had found the novel under
Bodefeldt’s bureau and had held up Pete to give him a
page of dictation from the classic.</p>

<p>“Are you going to the Crossing to-morrow?” Hardin
knew he should be too proud to betray his eagerness, but
the words ran away with him.</p>

<p>“Not to-morrow. Mr. Rickard just told me he might
not be able to get off until next week.”</p>

<p>Hardin’s anger sputtered. “Next week. Why does
he rush so? Why doesn’t he go next year? The Colorado’s
so gentle, it’d wait for him, I’m sure. Next week! It’s
a put-up job, that’s what it is. Oh, I can see through a
fence with a knot-hole as big as your head. He doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
want to finish the head-gate. He wants to put off going
until it’s too late to go on with it; I know him. He’d
risk the whole thing, and all the money the O. P. has
chucked into it, just to start with a clean slate; to get
the glory of stopping the river himself. It turns my
stomach; it’s a plot.” The lower lip shot out.</p>

<p>MacLean’s attention was deferential. He had always
liked Hardin; all the fellows did. But he was jumping
off wrong this time. He’d brought it all on himself.</p>

<p>“One would think he’d been brought up in a convent,
he finds the valley so distracting. Time to go to dinners.
Sickening!”</p>

<p>MacLean did not understand the allusion.</p>

<p>“He said,” MacLean hesitated, wondering if the statement
had been a confidence. But Bodefeldt had been
there. “He said something about a levee for the towns.
He’s got to investigate that before he goes to the front.”</p>

<p>“A levee? Well, wouldn’t that jar you?” Hardin addressed
the stenographer in the transparent shirt-waist.
“Does he think we’re going to have another flood this
season? Thinks it’s going to reach the hotel and wet his
clothes? Take the starch out of his shirts?” He flung
out of his chair, throwing the papers back into a drawer.</p>

<p>He stamped out of the office, mad clear through. To
this crisis they had sent down a dandy, a bookman who
wanted to build a levee. Oh, hell! He laughed out his
bitterness aloud, and did not care that Coulter, who kept
the store, and two gaily dressed squaws turned to look
after him. For it was a crisis, and the O. P. was making
it so. They should have learned their lesson by this time.
Trust <i>Maitland</i>? And now, Rickard!</p>

<p>“They’ll come crawling after me to help them after
this fellow’s buried himself under river mud, come calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to me as they did after Maitland failed. ‘Please, Mr.
Hardin, won’t you come back and finish your gate!’ I’ll
see them dead first. No, I’ll be fool enough to do it. I
can’t help myself. I’m a Hardin. I have to finish what
I’ve begun.”</p>

<p>It was not because this was a pet enterprise, the great
work of his life, that he must eagerly eat humble pie,
take the buffets, the falls, and come whining back when
they whistled to him. He told himself that it was because
of his debt to the valley, to the ranchers. He saw
himself sacrificing everything to a great obligation. “Who
was the Bible fellow who led his people across the desert?
I must polish up my Bible,” he resolved. He remembered
that he had not opened one since his mother’s
death, and that was so long past that the thought brought
no physical thrill.</p>

<p>The colonists were about desperate. Who could blame
them? The last year’s floods had worked havoc with
their crops; this year had been a horror. The district
they called Number Six was a screaming irony of ruin.
The last debauch of the river had made great gashes
through the ranches, had scoured deep gorges which had
undermined the canals on which the water supply for
Number Six depended. The suits were piling up against
the D. R., damage suits, and they hold up his gate,
while he gets the curses of the valley. And Mr. Rickard
thinks he’ll build a levee!</p>

<p>Hardin was in the mood to fancy slights. He was
convinced that Petrie went back into the bank to avoid
him. Two ranchers, Hollister and Wilson, from the
Palo Verde, busy with their teams, did not return his
halloo. The ranchers hated him. “That’s what you get
for crucifying yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>He flung himself on the couch in the tent. Gerty was
laying a careful cloth for supper. A brave determined
smile was arranged on her lips. The noon storm had
passed. She hummed a gay little tune. If there was
anything Hardin hated, it was humming.</p>

<p>“You’ll have your dude to dinner all right,” her
husband announced. “He’s in town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” rejoined his spouse. “I had a letter
from him yesterday. From Imperial.”</p>

<p>Tom sat up glaring. “He wrote to you from <i>Imperial</i>?”</p>

<p>His wife misplaced the accent. She misunderstood
Tom’s scowl. It was the old story over again. Whenever
those two men came together, the old feeling of
jealousy must be revived again! It was unpleasant, of
course, very unpleasant to have men care like that, but it
made life exciting. Life had been getting a little stale
lately; like a book of obvious even plot. Rickard’s
entrance into the story gave a new interest, a new twist.
She hummed an air from a new opera that had set the
world waltzing.</p>

<p>Hardin’s thoughts did not touch her at the hem. He
was at the head-gate, his gate. What the deuce had
Rickard gone to Imperial for? If he wasn’t the darndest
ass! Imperial! And the gate hung up!</p>

<p>“For God’s sake stop that buzzing!”</p>

<p>The happy little noise was quenched. Innes, entering
at that moment, heard the rough order. She looked imploringly
at her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Supper’s on the table,” cried Gerty, the fixed determined
smile still on her lips.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A DESERT DINNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INNES HARDIN was completing her simple toilet.
Not even to please Gerty would she “dress up” for
this dinner! It would have been easy for her sister-in-law
to postpone it. How could she expect Tom to go
through with it! She couldn’t understand Gerty!</p>

<p>An hour ago, hearing distinctly the whir and splash of
egg-beating, she had run over to the neighboring tent.
The clinking of cake-tins had suddenly silenced. “Excuse
me, won’t you?” Gerty’s voice had come from the
lean-to, the little kitchen shed. “I’m lying down.”</p>

<p>“Lieing, yes!” grimaced the Hardin mouth to its reflection
in the mirror. How many times that week had
she been repulsed by a locked door, a sudden curtain of
silence, or a “Run away for a while. I’m trying to catch
a nap.” Easy now to see why Gerty had wanted to “hold
the reins” that week!</p>

<p>She didn’t need to pierce those canvas walls to know
that there had been feverish activity for this dinner. A
new gown would appear to-night, made secretly. An
exquisite meal, and no one must comment on its elaboration.
Twice Tom and she had been asked to take their
lunch at the hotel. “Because of a headache!” A headache!</p>

<p>Tom’s wife could not even shop openly! Bundles had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
always the air of mystery, never opened before Tom or
herself. She must have yards of stuff laid away, kept
for sudden emergencies.</p>

<p>“She can’t help it. It’s her disposition. She can’t help
being secretive. Look at your face, Innes Hardin!”
What was it to her, the pettiness of a woman whom an
accident of life had swept upon the beach beside her?
Gerty was not her kind, not the sort she would pick out
for a friend. She was an oriental, one of the harem
women, whose business it is in life to please one man,
keep his home soft, his comforts ready, keep him convinced,
moreover, that it is the desire of his life to support
her. Herself dissatisfied, often rebellious, staying
by him for self-interest, not for love—ah, that was her
impeachment. “Not loving!”</p>

<p>Soberly, she covered her plain brassière with a white
waist of cotton ducking. A red leather belt and crimson
tie she added self-consciously. “Where is my bloodstone
pin?”</p>

<p>Hadn’t she spent an hour at least matching that particular
leather belt? But he was a man, in battle. The
head-gate held up; it was too bad. Silent, Bodefeldt,
Wooster, Grant, all of them fighting mad because of the
deadlock at the Heading. All up in arms, at last, against
Marshall, because of this cruel cut to their hero, Hardin.
Her eyes glowed like yellow lamps, as she recalled their
fervid partisanship.</p>

<p>“Only one man who can save the valley, and that’s
Tom Hardin.” Wooster had said that; but they all believed
it. The loyalty of the force made her ashamed of
her soft woman fears. For there were times when she
questioned her brother’s executive ability. He had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
large loose way of handling things. He was too optimistic.
But those men, those engineers must know. It
was probably the man’s way of sweeping ahead, ignoring
detail. The verdict of those field-tried men told her that
the other, the careful planning way, was the office
method. Rickard, as a dinner neighbor, she had found
interesting; but for great undertakings, a man who would
let a Gerty Holmes jilt him, ruin his life for him! The
whole story sprang at last clear, from the dropped innuendos.</p>

<p>She adjusted a barrette in her smoothly brushed hair.
Slowly, she walked over to the neighboring tent.</p>

<p>Gerty frowned at the white duck. “You might at least
have worn your blue!”</p>

<p>“You’re elegant enough for the two of us. Isn’t that
something new?”</p>

<p>Gerty said carelessly that she had had it for a long
time. For she had had the material a long time! It
wasn’t necessary to explain to her husband’s sister that
it had been made up that week. She hoped that she
didn’t look “fussed-up.” Would Mr. Rickard think she
was attaching any importance to the simple little visit?
For it was nothing to him, of course. A man of his
standing, whom the great Tod Marshall ranked so high,
probably dined out several times each week, with white-capped
maids and candelabra! If Tom had only made
the most of his opportunities. What a gamble, life to a
woman!</p>

<p>She made a trip into her bedroom and took a reassuring
survey in her mirror. The lingerie frock <i>would</i>
look simple to a man who would never suspect it of handmade
duplicity. Her glass declared the hand-whipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
medallions casual and elegant. And a long time ago, a
lifetime ago, Rickard had told her that she always should
wear blue, because of her eyes.</p>

<p>Innes from the next room could hear Gerty teasing
Tom to wear his Tuxedo.</p>

<p>“Isn’t one dude enough for you?” growled her surly
lord. Innes recognized the mood, and shrank from the
ordeal ahead. It was the mood of the Hardin in the
rough, the son of his frontier mother, the fruit of old
Jasper Gingg, whose smithy had been the rendezvous
for the wildest roughs, the fiercest cattlemen in Missouri.</p>

<p>“I’d let him see you know what’s what, even if we do
live like gipsies.”</p>

<p>The answer to that was another growl. Innes could
hear him dragging out the process, grumbling over each
detail. That confounded laundry had torn his shirt. He
hadn’t a decent collar to his name. Where was his black
string tie? If Gert <i>would</i> keep his things in the lowest
drawer! Hang that button! Gerty emerged from the
encounter, her face very red. Innes could see her biting
her lips to keep the tears back as she put the last touches
to the table.</p>

<p>“She’s tired out,” thought the sister of Tom Hardin.
“She’s probably fussed herself to death over this dinner.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Rickard arrived in a sack suit of
tweeds. Gerty’s greeting was a little abstracted. How
could she make Innes understand to tell Tom to change
his coat? The duty of a host, she suddenly remembered,
was to dress down rather than up, to the chances of his
guest. She regretted bitterly her insistence. Was ever
any one so obtuse as Innes? Mr. Rickard would see that
they thought it a big event. She was watching the curtain
where Tom would emerge. And his coat was a style<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
of several seasons ago and absurdly tight! She made an
unintelligible excuse, and darted behind the portière.</p>

<p>Tom’s face was apoplectic. He was wrestling with a
mussed tie; the collar showed a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>Gerty made wild signals for him to change his clothes.
She waved a hand indicating Rickard; she pointed to
Tom’s sack suit lying on the floor where he had walked
out of it.</p>

<p>“What is it all about?”</p>

<p>“Ssh,” whispered his wife. Again the wild gestures.</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you satisfied? Don’t I look like a guy?”</p>

<p>He could be heard distinctly in the next room. Gerty
gave it up in despair. She dabbed some more powder
on her nose, and went out looking like a martyr; a very
pretty martyr!</p>

<p>Rickard praised the miracles of the tent. Gerty’s soft
flush reminded Innes of their old relation. “Exit Innes,”
she was thinking, when Tom, red and perspiring, brought
another element of discomfort into the room.</p>

<p>Gerty ushered them immediately to the table. She
covered the first minutes which might be awkward with
her small chatter. Somewhere she had read that it was
not well to make apologies for lack of maid or fare. Besides,
Mr. Rickard remembered Lawrence! That dreadful
dining-room, the ever-set table! How she had hated it,
though she had not known how fearful it was until she
had escaped.</p>

<p>“We are simple folk here, Mr. Rickard,” she announced,
as they took their places around the pretty table.
That was her only allusion to deficiencies, but it covered
her noiseless movements around the board between
courses, filled up the gaps when she made necessary dives
into kitchen or primitive ice-chest, and set the key for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the homeliness of the meal itself. The dinner was a
triumph of apparent simplicity. Only Innes could guess
the time consumed in the perfection of detail, details
dear to the hostess’ heart. The almonds she had blanched,
of course, herself; had dipped and salted them. The
cheese-straws were her own. She did not make the mistake
of stringing out endless courses. An improvised
buffet near at hand made the serving a triumph.</p>

<p>Rickard praised each dish; openly he was admiring her
achievement. Innes, remembering the story Gerty had
told her in dots and dashes, the story of the old rivalry,
glanced covertly at Tom sulking at the head of his own
table.</p>

<p>“Poor sulky Achilles,” she thought. “Dear, honest old
bear!”</p>

<p>“Innes!” cried Mrs. Hardin.</p>

<p>She turned to find that the guest was staring at her.
She had not heard his effort to include her in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rickard asked you if you like it here?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, why, of course!” Her answer sounded
pert to herself.</p>

<p>Her sister-in-law hastened to add that Miss Hardin
was very lonely, was really all alone in the world; that
they insisted on her making her home with them.</p>

<p>Innes had with difficulty restrained a denial. After
all, what other home had she? Still the truth had been
deflected. She recalled the sacrifice it had been to cut
her college course in order to make a home in the desert
for the brother who had always so gently fathered her,
who had helped her invest her small capital that it might
spell a small income. She recalled his resistance when
she had called in a mortgage; who could watch that mad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
scapegoat of a river playing pranks with desert homes,
and not yearn to help? Not a Hardin. She still gloried
in remembering that she had at least driven one pile into
that rebellious stream, even if when she left the valley it
would be as a breadwinner. She was prepared. She was
a good draftsman; she would go as an apprentice in
an architect’s office. She had already settled on the
architect!</p>

<p>“Are you going to Los Angeles again soon?” She
heard the new manager address his host.</p>

<p>“I’m taking orders!”</p>

<p>There was another awkward moment when Hardin
pushed back his plate declaring he had reached his limit;
it was too big a spread for him! It was the stupid rudeness
of the small bad boy; even Innes flushed for her
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>With resolution, Gerty assumed control of the conversation.
Her rôle sounded casual; no one could have suspected
it of frequent rehearsal. They must not talk of
the river; that was taboo. Railroad matters were also
excluded. Equally difficult would be reminiscences of
Lawrence days. So she began brightly with a current
book. Had Mr. Rickard read <i>The Home of Joy</i> that
every one was discussing? Rickard confessed he was a
barbarian; he had not read a book that was not on engineering
for many a month. He had read a review or
two, and several minutes were contributed to a discussion
of the problem it covered. The theater proved a
safe topic, and by that natural route, they reached New
York. Innes, who had never been farther East than
Chicago, was grateful to play audience. Hardin, who
knew his New York perhaps better than either, refused
to be drawn into the gentle stream. Gerty skimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
easily the cream of modern issues; she read her newspaper
religiously each morning; they talked of popular
movements. There had been a demonstration in the
streets of London, rock-throwing mobs of suffragettes
the week before.</p>

<p>“Surely, they proved their equality,” observed Casey
Rickard. Innes was angry with herself for smiling.</p>

<p>“What about their right?” She wanted to urge the
right of the wage-earners, the taxpayers. Taxation without
representation, but she heard her chance pass by.
Gerty had danced on to another topic.</p>

<p>Things must be kept sprightly. Had Mr. Rickard met
many of the valley people? And it was then that she
threw her bomb toward the listening silent Hardins. She
would like Mr. Rickard to meet some of their friends.</p>

<p>He said that he would be delighted, but that he was
planning to leave shortly for the Heading.</p>

<p>“Of course.” She did not give her husband time to
speak. She meant afterward! She was planning to
give something, a bit novel, in his honor. She refused to
see the glare from the angry man in his outgrown dinner
coat. She did not glance toward the sister. What
did Mr. Rickard think about a progressive ride?</p>

<p>“It sounds very entertaining, but what do you do?”</p>

<p>There was a loud guffaw from Tom. With deepened
color, Gerty told her idea. A drive, changing partners,
so he could meet all the guests. There was such a handsome
girl in the valley, a Miss Morton. Visiting her
brother, young Morton, of Philadelphia, the Mortons.
His father a millionaire, himself a Harvard graduate,
and he was running a melon ranch in the desert! There
were the Youngbergs; Mr. Youngberg, the manager of
the great A B C ranch, which belongs to Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Graves, you know? Mrs. Youngberg, the senator’s own
niece. And the Blinns, Mr. and Mrs. Blinn, not <i>quite</i>
the same class of people, but so jolly and entertaining.
Mr. Blinn makes you scream! And young Sutcliffe, the
English zanjero, a remittance man, of course. Englished,
the word wasn’t so pretty; it meant ditch-tender.</p>

<p>“And the Wilson girls. I was forgetting about them.
They are with their brother, who owns one of the big
ranches here. He is picking grapes, think of it, off vines
not four years old.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a wonderful land,” agreed her guest.</p>

<p>“I think it will surprise you to find so many nice people
in here; it certainly did me. One doesn’t expect to find
congenial people in a new country like this. They say
it is the quick rewards which attract ambitious men. Why,
how much was it Jones cleared off his place last year,
Tom? He was sending tomatoes east in February, grown
in the open. This is really a huge forcing bed, isn’t it?
I’ve heard it said, too, that there is an intellectual stimulus
which attracts one class, and develops the other. Do
you agree with that, Mr. Rickard?”</p>

<p>Just like the sparrow, darting from bough to bough!
He answered, gravely, that they certainly used a dictionary
of their own! He had been to a meeting of the
water companies, up at Imperial the other day. He
turned to his host. “The fluency of some of those men
surprised me!”</p>

<p>“We’re not all dubs!” gruffed Hardin.</p>

<p>Gerty swept up her ruffles; her laugh sounded hard
instead of gay. It was a kindness for a newcomer to
bring in a breath of fresh air from the outside. They did
get stale, they couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>Rickard remembered that he had to get back to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
hotel. He had letters to write. It had been a splendid
dinner! And what a wonderful home she had made out
of a sand-baked lot, out of a tent! He spoke of the roses
and the morning-glories. His eyes fell on the open piano,
the reading table with the current magazines. Now, he
couldn’t understand why they ever went to that hotel!</p>

<p>Gerty’s eyes were shining as deep pools of water on
which the sun plays. She looked almost infantile as she
stood by the two tall men, her head perched bird-like.
“Good-by! and I hope you’ll come again!”</p>

<p>Of course he’d come again!</p>

<p>“And you will let me know when you return, so that I
may set the date for my party?”</p>

<p>Innes did not get his answer. She had been observing
that he was not taller than her brother. He looked taller.
He was lean, and Tom was growing stocky. She wished
he would not slouch so, his hands in his pockets! In
Tucson, before she knew that she must dislike Rickard,
she had had an impression of virile distinction, of grace,
a suggestion of mastered muscles. He had <i>known</i> that
it was her brother he was supplanting—did he get any
satisfaction from the fact that it was the husband of the
woman who had jilted him? Anyway, she did not like
him. She could never forgive a hurt that was done to
her own. She was a Hardin.</p>

<p>“Innes! Mr. Rickard said good night!”</p>

<p>She gave him the tips of her cool browned fingers.
Her eyes did not meet his; she would not meet that
laughing scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Rickard.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE FIGHTING CHANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“CASEY’S back; spying!” announced Wooster at
mess one evening. By that time, the feeling against
“Marshall’s man” was actively hostile. There had
been a smudge of slumbering fires before Rickard had
left the towns. Fanned by much talk during his absence,
it had burst into active blaze. They were ready
to show their resentment against the man who had supplanted
Hardin, their Napoleon, if it cost them their
places. By this time the cause of the desert was as compelling
to these hardy soldiers as were the lily banners
of France to the followers of the Little Corporal.</p>

<p>Rickard was not expected. He had been gone less than
a week. The effect of his return was that of a person
who returns suddenly into a room, hushing an active babel
of tongues. He knew what he would find, ample reasons
why! He was not given the satisfaction of locating
any particular act of disobedience. The men presented
a blank wall of politeness, reasonable and ineffectual.
Silent explained, briefly, that he had not been able to collect
enough men. Most of the force was busy in the
Number Six District, trying to push the shattered Wistaria
through by a new route before that year’s crops
were entirely ruined. A gang was at Grant’s Heading;
the floor needed bracing. Another squad, Irish’s, was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the Volcano Lake Region, where they were excavating
for the new head-gate.</p>

<p>“No hurry for that.” Rickard was glad to pick a flaw
in such a perfect pattern. “You might have withdrawn
those men, and put them to work on the levee.”</p>

<p>“I was given no authority to do that.”</p>

<p>The chief pretended to accept the reason; else it were
a case of changing horses in mid-stream. What he had
seen at the Heading, his peep at the exposed valley, his
gleaning of the river’s history had convinced him that
in haste and concentration lay the valley’s only chance.
He must refuse to see the insubordination of the engineers,
the seasoned desert-soldiers. He needed them,
must win their confidence if he could. If not, they must
save the valley, anyway! The imperturbable front of
Silent, his bland big stare, exasperated him; easier to
control the snapping terrier of a Wooster. He had told
Silent distinctly to gather his men and rush the levee. A
good soldier had made a better guess than his, and had
stopped the casual work at Black Butte, or had found
Indians! Thoughtfully, Rickard followed that last suggestion
across the ditch into Mexicali.</p>

<p>He gathered all the recruits he needed that morning.
The Indians, lazy Cocopahs, crept out of their huts to
earn a few of the silver dollars held out to them by the
new white boss. A few Mexican laborers were bribed
to toss up earth to the west of the town. Estrada, at his
request, put a squad of his road force at the service of
the manager. He could not spare many men.</p>

<p>The railroad had already started the line projected by
Hardin to Marshall the year before, a spur across the
desert, dipping into Mexico between the lean restless
sand-hills, from Calexico to Yuma. The Mexican government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
had agreed to pay five thousand dollars a mile were
the road completed at a certain period. Estrada was
keeping his men on the jump to fill the contract, to make
his nation pay the price. The completion of the road
meant help to the valley; supplies, men, could be rushed
through to the break.</p>

<p>In spite of his haunting sense of ultimate failure, the
growing belief in the omnipotence of the Great Yellow
Dragon as the Cocopahs visualized it, Estrada’s work
was as intense as though he were hastening a sure victory.
The dauntless spirit of the elder Estrada pushed
the track over the hot sands where he must dance at
times to keep his feet from burning. Many of the rails
they laid at night.</p>

<p>“Hog-wild!” exclaimed Hardin when he saw the levee
for the first time. “Gone hog-wild.” To him, the growing
ridge of fine earth, like a soft heap of pulverized
chocolate, was an absurd proof of misdirected energy.
He walked down with Silent after dark to the gorge the
river had cut on its last wild debauch, and stood on the
newly upturned mound of earth. There was no water
running now in the flood channel; it was a deep dry scar.</p>

<p>“It would be a good idea if it were necessary. It can
do no harm.”</p>

<p>“Do no harm, and the gate hung up! He makes me
sick. We’ve had all the floods coming to us this twenty
years. He’s locking the barn after the horse is gone.”</p>

<p>The calm beauty of that desert night was wasted on
the man whose life, he told himself, had been dishonored.
He did not smell the pungent breath, the damp moist
sweetness of the newly turned earth; did not see the star-pricked
canopy spreading out toward illimitable horizons.
The moon trailed its cold pale light across the sky, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Hardin could not see. His view was a world of his making,
a country peopled by his energy, the people who had
turned him down. The eyes that were looking at the
levee were no longer seeing another man’s folly; they
were visualizing his head-gate, the gate that meant safety
to the valley, the gate he was not allowed to complete.
He was living over again, step by step, the chain of
events that led to this exasperating deadlock; himself,
incapacitated, helpless, seeing the thing which should be
done, powerless to do it. The men who might win,
petty enough to let the wish to put him in the wrong
override the big opportunity to save the valley! He
wondered again why he had not the sense to get out.</p>

<p>“And kick the whole bucket over,” he grumbled. “I
would, too, if I had the sense I was born with. Get out,
and begin over again somewhere. Not stay for more
kicks. They’d find they’d be wanting me back again. I
will get out. I’ll not stay a month longer.”</p>

<p>“Rickard’s gone hog-wild,” he told his family the next
morning. “Building a levee between the towns! The
man’s off his head.”</p>

<p>“There really isn’t any danger?” Gerty’s anxiety made
the deep blue eyes look black.</p>

<p>Innes looked up for Tom’s answer. His face was ugly
with passion.</p>

<p>“Danger! It’s a bluff, a big show of activity here,
because he’s buffaloed; he doesn’t know how to tackle
the job out there.”</p>

<p>It had begun to look that way to more than one. It was
talked over at Coulter’s store; in the outer office of the
D. R. Company where the engineers foregathered; among
the chair-tilters who idled in front of the Desert Hotel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
“The man does not know how to tackle his job!” A levee,
and the gate held up! What protection to the towns
would be that toy levee if the river should return on one
of its spectacular sprees? A levee, and the intake itself
not guarded? He was whispered of as an incompetent;
one of Marshall’s clerks. He was given a short time to
blow himself out. A bookman, a theorist.</p>

<p>“As well put sentinels a few miles from prison, and
leave the jail doors open!” This was Wooster’s gibe. All
saw the Colorado as a marauder at large. “And a little
heap of sand stacked up to scare it off! It’s a scream!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin found it difficult to meet with diplomacy
the confidences which inevitably came her way. As
Hardin’s wife, she was expected to enjoy the universal
censure the new man was acquiring. Gerty’s light
touches, too slight for championship, passed as a sweet
charity. Her own position those days was trying. She
did not yet know her diplomatic lesson.</p>

<p>Apparently unaware of the talk, Rickard spent the
greater part of his time superintending the levee. He
could trust no one else to do it, no one unless it were
Estrada, who was rushing his steel rails through to the
front, and was needed there.</p>

<p>Things were moving under his constant goading. The
extra pay was showing results. He should be at the
Heading now, he kept telling himself, but he was convinced
that the instant he turned his back, the work on
the levee would stop; and all the reasons excellent! Some
emergency would be cooked up to warrant the withdrawal
of the hands. Chafe as he might at the situation, it was
to be guerrilla warfare. Not a fight in the open, he
knew how to meet that, but this baffling resistance, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
polite silence of the office when he entered,—“Well,
they’ll be doing my way pretty soon, or my name isn’t
Rickard. That’s flat.”</p>

<p>He was fretting to be at work, to start the wheels of
the O. P., its vast machinery toward his problem. He
knew that that organization, like well-drilled militia, was
ready for his call. The call lagged, not that he did not
need men, but there was no place ready for them. The
camp, that was another rub. There was no camp! It
was not equipped for a sudden inflation of men. The
inefficiency of the projectors of this desert scheme had
never seemed so criminal as when he had surveyed the
equipment at the intake. “Get ready first; your tools,
your stoves, your beds.” That was the training of the
good executive, of men like Marshall and MacLean.
Nothing to be left to chance; to foresee emergencies, not
to be taken by them unaware. The reason of Hardin’s
downfall was his slipshod habits. How could he be a good
officer who had never drilled as a soldier? There was
the gap at the intake, Hardin’s grotesque folly, widened
from one hundred feet to ten times the original cut;
widening every day, with neither equipment nor camp
adequate to push through a work of half the original
magnitude. Cutting away, moreover, was the island,
Disaster Island; it had received apt christening by the
engineers, its baptismal water the Colorado. The last
floods had played with it as though it were a bar of
sugar. There was no rock at hand; no rock on the way,
no rock ordered. Could any one piece together such
recklessness?</p>

<p>Rickard knew where he would get his rock. Already
he had requisitioned the entire output of the Tacna and
Patagonia quarries. He had ordered steam shovels to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
be installed at the quarry back of old Hamlin’s. That
rock pit would be his first crutch, and the gravel bed,—that
was a find! As he paced the levee west of the
towns, he was planning his campaign. Porter was scouring
Zacatecas for men; he himself had offered, as bait,
free transportation; the O. P. he knew would back him.
He was going to throw out a spur-track from the Heading,
touching at the quarry and gravel pit, on to the main
road at Yuma. Double track most of the way; sidings
every three miles. Rock must be rushed; the trains must
be pushed through. He itched to begin. It never occurred
to him that, like Hardin, he might fail.</p>

<p>“Though it’s no pink tea,” he told himself, “it’s no
picnic.” At Tucson, he knew that the situation was a
grave one, but his talk with Brandon, who knew his
river signs as does a good Indian, made the year a significant,
eventful one. Matt Hamlin, too, whose shrewd
eyes had grown river-wise, he, too, had had tales to tell
of the tricky river. Maldonado, the half-breed, had confirmed
their portents while they sat together under his
oleander, famous throughout that section of the country.
And powerfully had Cor’nel, the Indian who had piloted
Estrada’s party across the desert, whom Rickard had
met at the Crossing, deeply had he impressed him. The
river grew into a malevolent, mocking personality; he
could see it a dragon of yellow waters, dragging its slow
sluggish length across the baked desert sands; deceiving
men by its inertness; luring the explorer by a mild mood,
to rise suddenly with its wild fellow, the Gila, sending
boat and boatmen to their swift doom.</p>

<p>Rickard was thinking of the half-breed, Maldonado,
as he inspected the new stretch of levee between the
towns. He had heard from others besides Estrada of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the river knowledge of this descendant of trapper and
squaw, and had thought it worth while to ride the twenty
miles from down the river to talk with him. The man’s
suavity, his narrow slits of eyes, the lips thin and facile,
deep lines of cruelty falling from them, had repelled his
visitor. The mystery of the place followed him. Why
the ’dobe wall which completely surrounded the small
low dwellings? Why the cautious admittance, the atmosphere
of suspicion? Rickard had seen the wife, a
frightened shadow of a woman; had seen her flinch when
the brute called her. He had questioned Cor’nel about
the half-breed. He was remembering the wrinkles of
contempt on the old Indian’s face as he delivered himself
of an oracular grunt.</p>

<p>“White man? No. Indian? No! Coyote!”</p>

<p>Though he suspected Maldonado would lie on principle,
though it might be that two-thirds of his glib tissue
were false, yet a thread of truth coincident with the
others, Brandon and Hamlin and Cor’nel, might be pulled
out of his romantic fabric.</p>

<p>“When the waters of the Gila run red, look for
trouble!” He doubted that they ever ran red. He would
ask Cor’nel. He had also spoken of a cycle, known to
Indians, of a hundredth year, when the Dragon grows
restless; this he had declared was a hundredth year.</p>

<p>On the road from Maldonado’s, Rickard had met
several Indians swaying from their saddles; a half-breed
lurching unsteadily toward Yuma. He had made note
of that. Who was selling liquor to those Indians, those
half-breeds? Maldonado could have told him, Maldonado
who wore the dirty unrecognizable uniform of
a rurale. Rickard was going to use Indian labor; must
depend, he knew, for steady work, the brush clearing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the mattress weaving, on the natives. If any one was
selling mescal and tequila within a day’s ride of the
Heading, it was his place to find out.</p>

<p>Following his talk with Maldonado, and the accidental
happy chance meeting with Coronel at the Crossing,
Rickard had written his first report to Tod Marshall.
Before he had come to the Heading, he had expected to
advise against the completion of the wooden head-gate
at the Crossing. Hamlin had given him a new view-point.
There was a fighting chance. And he wanted to be fair.
Next to being successful, he wanted to be fair.</p>

<p>He smiled as he remembered MacLean’s cramped fingers
after the dictation was done. “Holy Minnie,” he
had exclaimed, rubbing his joints. “If you call that
going slow!”</p>

<p>“It’s time to be hearing from Marshall,” Rickard was
thinking, as he walked back to the hotel. “I wonder
what he will say.” He felt it had been fair to put it up to
Marshall; personally, he would like to begin with a clean
slate; begin right. Clumsy work had been done, it was
true, yet there were urgent reasons now for haste; and
the gate was nearly half done! He had gone carefully
over the situation. The heavy snowfall, unprecedented
for years, a hundred, according to the Indians,—on the
Wind River Mountains—the lakes swollen with ice, the
Gila restless, the summer floods yet to be met; perhaps,
he now thought, he had been overfair in emphasizing the
arguments for the head-gate. For the hundred feet were
now a thousand feet—yet he had spoken of that to Marshall:
“Calculate for yourself the difference in expense
since the flood widened the break. It is a vastly different
problem now. Disaster Island, which they figured
on for anchor, is a mere pit of corroding sugar in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
channel. An infant Colorado could wash it away. However,
a lot of work has already been done, and a lot of
money spent. There is a fighting chance. Perhaps the
bad year is all Indian talk.”</p>

<p>A guess, at best, whatever they did! It was pure
gamble what the tricky Colorado would do. Anyway,
he had given the whole situation to Marshall.</p>

<p>In his box at the hotel was a telegram which had been
sent over from the office; from Tod Marshall. “Take
the fighting chance. But remember to speak more respectfully
of Indians!”</p>

<p>“Marshall all over,” laughed his subordinate. “Now,
it’s a case of hustle! But dollars to doughnuts, as Junior
says, we don’t do it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>HARDIN’S LUCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO days later, there was a shock of earthquake, so
slight that the lapping of the water in Rickard’s
bath was his intimation of the earth’s uneasiness. In
the dining-room, later, he found every one discussing it.
“Who could remember an earthquake in that desert?”
“The first shake!”</p>

<p>“The Indians might have something to say about that,”
thought Rickard.</p>

<p>His pompadoured waitress was ready to fall into hysteria.
“Several dishes fell off the pantry shelves. Give
me a Kansas cyclone to an earthquake, I say, every time.
For there is always a cyclone cellar. But the earth under
your feet! Me for Kansas, every time!”</p>

<p>After he had placed his breakfast order, while waiting
for his eggs—“Ten minutes in boiling water, off the
stove, mind!”—Rickard got the Crossing on the telephone.
Matt Hamlin answered the call. He insisted on describing
the exact place he had stood when the shock came.
It wasn’t anything of a quake. A baby to the shake of
’67. No harm done out there. While he was on the line,
Rickard heard the sound of other voices. “It’s Silent
just in from the Heading.” “Hello, there,” cried Rickard.
“Don’t hang up. Ask him about the gate. Any
damage done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Silent, himself, came on the wire. The gate was all
right. “That was nothing of a quake.” Rickard then
got Grant’s Heading. The temblor had been felt more
there, but no serious damage had been done. Rickard
went back to his boiled eggs. The earthquake was forgotten.</p>

<p>During the morning, unfathered, as rumors are born,
the whisper of disaster somewhere spread. Their own
slight shock was the edge of the convulsion which had
been serious elsewhere, no one knew quite where, or
why they knew it at all. The men who were shoveling
earth on the levee began to talk of San Francisco. Some
one said, that morning, that the city was badly hurt. No
one could confirm the rumor, but it grew with the day.</p>

<p>Rickard met it at the office late in the afternoon. The
word was growing in definiteness. There was trouble
up North. A terrible disaster; people had been killed;
towns were burning. There was a report of a tidal
wave which had swept San Francisco. Another quoted
that San Jose had telegraphed all the wires from San
Francisco down; that San Francisco was burning.
He went direct to the telegraph operator’s desk.</p>

<p>“Get Los Angeles, the O. P. office. And be quick
about it.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes, he was talking to Babcock. That
human clock confirmed some of the ugly rumors. The
wires between San Francisco and the rest of the world
<i>were</i> down; impossible to get any word from there.</p>

<p>“Any relative there?” he inquired with sympathy on
tap. Such messages had been coming in all day.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. How much do you know? How do you
know it?” persisted Rickard.</p>

<p>Babcock said that the damage by earthquake to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
city was not known, but it was afire. San Jose had confirmed
it. Oakland had reported the flames creeping up
the residence hills of that gay western city. Cinders
were already falling in the transbay town.</p>

<p>Rickard dropped the receiver. “Where’s Hardin?”</p>

<p>Tom Hardin emerged from a knot of men who were
talking in a corner by the door.</p>

<p>“Where’s that machinery?”</p>

<p>“What machinery?”</p>

<p>Rickard saw the answer to his question in the other’s
face.</p>

<p>“The dredge machinery. Did you attend to that?
Did you send for it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s all right. It’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Is it here?”</p>

<p>Hardin attempted jocularity. “I didn’t know as you
wanted it here. I ordered it sent to Yuma.”</p>

<p>“Is it at Yuma?”</p>

<p>Hardin admitted that it was not yet at Yuma; it would
be there soon; he had written; oh, it was all right.</p>

<p>“When did you write?”</p>

<p>Hardin reddened under the catechism of questions.
He resented being held up before his men. The others
felt the electricity in the air. Hardin and his successor
were glaring at each other like belligerents.</p>

<p>“I asked when did you write?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday!” Rickard ripped out an oath. “Yesterday.
Why at all, I’d like to know? Did you understand
that you were ordered to get that here? Now, it’s
gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” The others crowded up.</p>

<p>“San Francisco’s burning.” He walked into his inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
office, mad clear through. The group around Hardin
were tearing his wisp of news. San Francisco on fire.
The city of their fun gone.</p>

<p>He was not thinking of the ruin of the gay young
city; not a thought yet did he have of the human tragedies
enacting there; of homes, lives, fortunes swept into
that huge bonfire. As it affected the work at the river,
the first block to his campaign, the catastrophe came
home to him. He had a picture of tortured, twisted
iron, of ruined machinery, the machinery for his dredge.
He saw it lying like a spent Laocoön, writhing in its
last struggle. He blamed himself for leaving even such a
small detail as the hastening of the parts to Hardin’s
care, for Hardin wasn’t fit to be trusted for anything.
No one could tell him now the man was unlucky; he was
a fool. A month wasted, and days were precious. A
month? Months. Hardin’s luck. Oh, hell!</p>

<p>Then he began to speculate, as he cooled, over the
trouble up yonder. A whole city burning? They would
surely get it under control. He began to think of the
isolation; the telegraph wires all down. That might happen
anywhere! He walked to the door and looked
thoughtfully at the company’s big water-tower. That
wasn’t such a bad idea! He picked up his hat, and went
out.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE WRONG MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. Hardin heard from every source but the right
one that Rickard had returned. Each time her
telephone rang, it was his voice she expected to hear.
She began to read a meaning into his silence. She could
think of nothing else than the strange coincidence that
had brought their lives again close. Or <i>was</i> it a coincidence?
That idea sent her thoughts far afield.</p>

<p>She was thinking too much of him, for peace of mind,
those days of waiting, but the return of the old lover
had made a wonderful break in her life. Her eyes were
brighter; her smile was less forced. She spent most of her
days at the sewing-machine. A lot of lace was whipped
on to lingerie frocks of pale colors. She was a disciple
of an eastern esthete. “Women,” he had said, “should
buy lace, not by the yard, but by the mile.”</p>

<p>She had attended his lectures while in New York,
acquiring a distaste for all her possessions. He had
taught her to disdain golden-oak, to fear bric-à-brac, to
forswear all vivid colors. She could see no charm in
the tailor-made girl, in Innes’ trig shirt-waists and well-cut
skirts. The yellow khakis always outraged her sense
of beauty. The girl’s ideas on fitness would have shocked
and wounded her.</p>

<p>As her fingers worked among the laces and soft mulls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
her mind roved down avenues that should have been
closed to her, a wife. She would have protested, had
any one accused her of infidelity in those days, yet day
by day, she was straying farther from her husband’s
side. She convinced herself that Tom’s gibes and ill-humor
were getting harder to endure.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the woman of harem training
should relive the Lawrence days. The enmity of those
two men, both her lovers, was pregnant with romantic
suggestion. The drama of desert and river centered now
in the story of Gerty Hardin. Rickard, who had never
married! The deduction, once unveiled, lost all its shyness.
And every one saw that he disliked her husband!</p>

<p>She knew now that she had never loved Tom. She
had turned to him in those days of pride when Rickard’s
anger still held him aloof. How many times had she
gone over those unreal hours! Who could have known
that his anger would last? That hour in the honeysuckles;
his kisses! None of Hardin’s rougher kisses
had swept her memory of her exquisite delight—delirious
as was her joy, there was room for triumph. She
had seen herself clear of the noisy boarding-house. Herself,
Gerty Holmes, the wife of a professor; able to have
the things she craved, to have them openly; no longer
having to scheme for them.</p>

<p>It was through Rickard’s eyes that she had seen the
shortcomings of the college boarding-house. She had
acquired a keen consciousness of those quizzical eyes.
When they had isolated her, at last, appealing to her
sympathy or amusement, separating her from all those
boisterous students, her dream of bliss had begun.</p>

<p>In those days, she had seen Hardin through the eyes of
the young instructor, younger by several years than his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
pupil. Her thud of disappointed anger, of dislike, when
the face of Hardin peered through the leafy screen! To
have waited, prayed for that moment, and to have it
spoiled like that! There had been days when she had
wept because she had not shown her anger! How could
she know that everything would end there; end, just
beginning! Her boarding-house training had taught her
to be civil. It was still vivid to her, her anxiety, her
tremulousness—with Hardin talking forever of a play
he had just seen; Rickard growing stiffer, angrier, refusing
to look at those lips still warm with his kisses!</p>

<p>And the next day, still angry with her. Ah, the puzzled
desolation of those weeks before she had salved her
hurt; with pride, and then with love! Those days of
misery before she could convince herself that she had
been in love with love, not with her fleeing lover! Hardin
was there, eager to be noticed. That affair, she could see
now, had lacked finesse.</p>

<p>Rickard had certainly loved her, or why had he never
married? Why had he left so abruptly his boarding-house,
in mid-term? Doesn’t jealousy confess love?
Some day, he would tell her; what a hideous mistake
hers had been! She ought not to have rushed into that
marriage. She knew now it had always been the other.
But life was not finished, yet!</p>

<p>The date set for her summer “widowhood” had come,
but she lingered. Various reasons, splendid and sacrificial,
were given out. There was much to be done.</p>

<p>“I wish she would be definite,” Innes’ thoughts complained.
She was restless to make her own plans. It
had not yet occurred to her that Gerty would stay in all
summer. For she never had so martyrized herself. “Some
one must be with Tom. It may spoil my trip. But Gerty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
never thinks of that.” She believed it to be a simple
matter of clothes. It always took her weeks to get ready
to go anywhere.</p>

<p>“But I won’t wait any longer than next week. If she
does not go then, I will. Absurd for us both to be here.”
It was already fiercely hot.</p>

<p>Gerty, meanwhile, had been wondering how she could
suggest to her sister-in-law that her trip be taken first.
Without arousing suspicions! Terribly loud in her ears
sounded her thoughts those days.</p>

<p>Her husband flung a letter on the table one evening.
“A letter to you from—Casey.”</p>

<p>She tried to make the fingers that closed over the
letter move casually. She could feel them tremble. What
would she say if Tom asked to see it?</p>

<p>It was addressed to her in her husband’s care. Hardin
had found it at the office in his mail. And she going each
day to the post-office to prevent it from falling into his
hands! She gave it a quick offhand glance.</p>

<p>“About the drive, of course. Supper’s getting cold.
Look at that omelet. Don’t wait to wash up. It will be
like leather.”</p>

<p>When she had finished her meal, she read her letter
with a fine show of indifference. “He sets a date for the
drive.” She put the letter carelessly into her pocket
before her husband could stretch out his hand. It would
never do for jealous Tom to read that: “Your letter was
received two weeks ago. Pardon me for appearing to
have forgotten your kindness.”</p>

<p>“The nerve,” growled Tom again, his mouth full of
Gerty’s omelet. “To take you up on an invitation like
that. I call that pretty raw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“You must remember we are such old friends,” urged
his wife. “He knew I meant it seriously.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, it’s nerve,” grumbled Hardin, helping
himself to more of the omelet, now a flat ruin in the
center of the Canton platter. His resentment had taken
on an edge of hatred since the episode of the dredge
machinery. “To write to any one in my house! He
knows what I think of him; an ineffectual ass, that’s
what he is. Blundering around with his little levees,
and his fool work on the water-tower.”</p>

<p>“The water-tower?” demanded his sister. “What’s he
doing with that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” rejoined Tom largely, his lips
protruding. He had been itching to ask some one what
Rickard was up to. Twice, he had seen him go up, with
MacLean and Estrada. Once, there was a large flare of
light. But he wouldn’t ask! Some of his fool tinkering!</p>

<p>His sister’s gaze rested on him with concern. He had
too little to do. She guessed that his title, consulting
engineer, was a mocking one, that his chief, at least, did
not consult him. Was it true, what she had heard, that
he had made a fluke about the machinery? He was looking
seedy. He had been letting his clothes go. He looked
like a man who has lost grip; who has been shelved.</p>

<p>She knew he was sleeping badly. Every morning now
she found the couch rumpled. Not much pretense of
marital congeniality. Things were going badly, there—</p>

<p>“Everybody has accepted,” Gerty was saying. “They
have been waiting for me to set the date.”</p>

<p>“And you cater to him, let him dangle you all. I wonder
why you do it, unless it’s to hurt me.”</p>

<p>“Hurt you, Tom,” cried his wife, her deep blue eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
wide with dismay. “How can you say such a thing?
But if it is given for him, how can I do anything else
than let him arrange the day to suit himself? It would
be funny for the guest of honor not to be present,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you want to make him a guest of
honor,” he retreated, covering his position.</p>

<p>Gently, Gerty expressed her belief that she was doing
the best thing for her husband in getting up a public
affair for his successor. She did think that Tom would
see that it showed they had no feeling.</p>

<p>“I think it a fine idea,” agreed Innes heartily. “I’m
sure Tom will, too, when he thinks about it.” But she
did not give him any chance to express himself. “How
are you going to manage it, Gerty? You said it was
going to be progressive?”</p>

<p>“We shall draw for partners,” said Mrs. Hardin.
“And change every half a mile. The first lap will be
two miles; that will give some excitement in cutting for
partners.” Easy, being the hostess, to withhold any slip
she pleased, easy to make it seem accidental!</p>

<p>“When is this circus coming off?” inquired her husband.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rickard says he will be back on the first; that
he’ll be free on the second.”</p>

<p>Hardin scraped his chair over the pine-board floor
which Gerty had helped Sam to treat until it looked
“hard.” Each alternate strip had been stained dark, the
whole waxed and rubbed until it almost gave a shadow,
the housekeeper’s idea of elegance.</p>

<p>“For half an hour, I’ll listen to Mrs. Youngberg tell
me how hard it is to have to do without servants, as
she’s never done it in her life before. For another half-mile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Mrs. Hatfield will flirt with me, and Mrs. Middleton
will tell me all about ‘her dear little kiddies,’ Sounds
cheerful. Why didn’t you choose cards? No one has to
talk then.”</p>

<p>There was an interval when his wife appeared to be
balancing his suggestion. “No, I think it will have to be
a drive; for I’ve told every one about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked her husband, “I only hope something
will happen to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Tom!” exclaimed Gerty Hardin. “What a dreadful
thing to say. That sounds like a curse. You make my
blood run cold.”</p>

<p>“Shu!” said Hardin, picking up his hat. “That was no
curse. You wouldn’t go if it rained, would you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rain!” She shrugged at that possibility.</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t go if the wind blows!” retorted
Hardin, leaving the room.</p>

<p>A minute later he stuck his head through the door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Youngberg’s outside.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Youngberg!” cried Gerty, pleasantly fluttered.
She ran out into the street without waiting to pick up a
hat. “For I’ll make her come in this time,” she thought.
“I won’t stand craning my neck and squinting up at her
as if she were the great high executioner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Youngberg leaned out from the box buggy, and
kissed her. “How are you these days?” Her voice was
solicitous.</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid!” Gerty smiled gaily toward the occupant
of the buggy, but the desert sun deflected the smile
into a grimace. “Won’t you come in to-day? Do tie up,
and have a little visit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t this morning. I have a hundred errands
to attend to, and I must get back in time to get lunch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
for my family. I lost my maid; isn’t it terrible down
here? You can’t keep a girl for a week. I don’t mind
cooking for my husband, but I do draw the line at being
cook for the hired men. And the coarse things they like!
You can’t always cook a double meal. And I lost one
of the best workers we ever had, that was when we first
came here, because he didn’t like the food I gave him.
Stuffed eggs, and Waldorf salad. What do you think
of that? It’s quantity they want, and that man went off
and said I’d starved him.”</p>

<p>“Do come in,” urged Gerty, squinting at the sun.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I’d like to, but I can’t. My husband likes
his meal prompt, and the men simply come in and sit
down, and watch you until it’s ready.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” interposed the other, half-blinded. “But
surely you can stay a minute. I have so many things to
tell you.”</p>

<p>“I, too. I want to have the ladies of the Improvement
Club in to tea before I go out; I think it will be Friday.
After I sound the ladies a little, I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>“Last year, she would have had <i>me</i> set the day.” Gerty
was on the outlook for stings; she felt that she had lost
her position in the valley set.</p>

<p>“Of course, that includes Miss Hardin,” added Mrs.
Youngberg, drawing up the reins.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk to you about the drive,” cried Mrs.
Hardin. “It is to be on the second. Will you take this
as the invitation, or must I write to you?”</p>

<p>“Please, don’t write.” And Mrs. Youngberg was driving
off when a thought seemed to strike her.</p>

<p>“I saw the levee as I was driving past. What in the
world is that for? Does Mr. Hardin think there will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
bigger floods than we’ve had already? Isn’t the New
River deep enough to carry all the flood waters?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin had never had her tact so completely
taxed. She balanced her answer carefully, with apprehension.
Almost anything would sound wrong quoted
as from her. She was Hardin’s wife; his success or
failure must still involve her. She could hear her answer
quoted to Mr. Rickard. “Mr. Hardin hoped it
would not be necessary.” And then warmly she praised
Rickard’s foresight in case anything did happen!</p>

<p>She went into the house, flushed and blinking and uncomfortable,
revolving a better, more diplomatic answer.
She was convinced that that last question had been the
object of the visit. These top-buggy visits, as Innes
called them, annoyed her. It was an irritation to all the
women of the towns, for Mrs. Youngberg never had
time to get out; she always would keep them standing
restive under the glare of desert sun. From the wife
of Youngberg, they would never have endured it. Senator
Graves made the situation a trifle delicate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE BEST LAID SCHEMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the forenoon of the second. Several times during
the morning Gerty left her preparations to take
forecasts of the weather. It was not so hot as it had
been and there was a moon. She congratulated herself;
it would be a fine night.</p>

<p>Her tent door was locked all morning. A new variety
of salad was on the way, the latest New York idea. For
hours, Gerty’s fingers were shredding the skins from
muscat grapes which were to be chilled, and served with
French dressing on crisp desert lettuce. The grapes, too,
were desert bred. It was a long task, and while her
fingers worked, her mind ran ahead nervously to the few
name-cards that had to be finished, white cards with a
design of the palo verde, the characteristic tree of the
region. The color scheme was pastel green and white.
Pistachio ice-cream and vanilla had been ordered from
Los Angeles, and Gerty herself had colored the cream
peppermints. Innes had suggested using the yellow blossoms
of the mesquit, but Mrs. Hardin hated yellow; it
was too “positive.”</p>

<p>Her eyes watched the clock hands. Eleven o’clock,
and those candle-shades not done! More time than she
had reckoned on had gone into the building of the white
mull lingerie dress; it had pressed her with the shades
and cards. And she had no time to work at night, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the Hardins were always around then. Not that there
was any reason why she should not occupy herself indeed
just as she chose, but she hated interference. If there
was anything she resented more than another, it was interference.
Rather than explain why she wanted name-cards,
or must have paper shades for the candles, or
moreover why it was necessary to have a frock that had
not been seen before, she preferred to lock her doors
and work “like mad.” Tom’s ridicule was so stupid,
and his sister was getting to be like him; not that she said
much, but she had such a scornful look!</p>

<p>The clock hands were flying. She stopped to count
the grapes already peeled and seeded. “At least fifteen
to each plate,” she had calculated. “And twenty guests,
twenty times fifteen—three hundred.” She counted
them again. “Only two hundred!” The clock hands
ticked away another half-hour. Her fingers began to
go wild; several finished grapes fell to the floor. “I’ll
wash them off,” she thought.</p>

<p>She was peeling the two hundred and fiftieth, when
there was a sound of wheels. A clear “Oo-hoo” summoned
her.</p>

<p>“It is Mrs. Youngberg.” She was horrified. “And she
wasn’t to come until after lunch.” She slipped off her
gingham apron and ran out breathless to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Hope you don’t mind my coming early,” called Mrs.
Youngberg. “It was now or never. Can you come with
me?” She waved to the greens in the box buggy. “And
are these enough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” responded Gerty absently. She was wondering
what in the world she would do about the unpeeled
grapes, and the unfinished shades and the name-cards.
Perhaps she could do with eleven. Innes had offered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
help; she supposed she could put her to work at the
grapes. But she hated to have people help, people who
looked scornful and superior. She could hear her say:
“Why all this fuss? Why not a simpler salad?” If
worse came to worse, she could put a plain card at her
husband’s place, and her own. She needed Mrs. Youngberg’s
help with the table—</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m putting you out,” her friend was taking
note of the discomfiture. “You are not ready?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin hastened to deny that. “Oh, yes! I was
just thinking what I’d take along. Will you come in?”
For once, she was grateful to the Youngberg habit of
the buggy. She took the answer for granted, and the
tent door mangled the response of the niece of Senator
Graves.</p>

<p>When she came out, her arms were overflowing with
bundles. A large hat box surmounted the smaller ones,
held in place by her chin. The top bulged open. As
she reached the sidewalk, her progress grew precarious,
for a slight wind was blowing. She had not closed the
hat box in fear of her precious shades.</p>

<p>“Give me something,” cried Mrs. Youngberg. She
caught the band-box. A gust of evil wind raised the top;
one of the shades blew out, and Gerty, helpless with
crockery in her hands, watched it tumble toward the
irrigation ditch. It danced, the pretty thing of pastel
green and white, on the surface of the muddy stream.</p>

<p>“You can save it,” cried Mrs. Youngberg. “Oh, what
a pity!” For as she spoke it collided with a floating
branch. Mud-splashed and ruined, it sailed down the
street.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that,” protested Gerty with magnificence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
She forced a cheery smile as she clambered over
her parcels into the buggy.</p>

<p>“And I was one short already!” she remembered as
they drove down the main street, the buggy heaped high
with boxes holding the treasured shades, the cards and
napkins, and a few choice plates. The supper was to be
at the hotel, but Gerty planned to use her own dishes
and cutlery—to give it a home-like feeling! Coulter’s
two clerks gaped at them from the store as they passed;
the buggy trailing long willow branches, and Gerty with
her boxes obscuring her vision.</p>

<p>In front of Fred Eggers’ store the usual group of
Indians lounged, the squaws careening in many ruffles,
the bucks brave in paint and shirts, heavy with beads.
Young Morton bowed to them from the bank windows
on which a man was laboriously working. He had already
finished a faint black outline, The Desert Bank,
and was beginning to fill in the first letter with gold-leaf.
The festive buggy made quite a stir in the desert town;
every one had heard of the progressive drive.</p>

<p>“The ditch is running very high this morning,” observed
Mrs. Youngberg, noting its muddy flow.</p>

<p>“Somebody is irrigating his melons.” Mrs. Hardin’s
observation was a trifle absent. She liked the attention
they were attracting. How she would love to be in a
position where she could use her social talents!</p>

<p>Mrs. Youngberg was reining up in front of the Desert
Hotel. Half a dozen men jumped forward to tie the
mare, and to help the ladies with their bundles. Gerty
declared she would not let them carry the packages; she
would send the boy after them. She felt the importance
of a leader of society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“You don’t mind if I do a few errands first,” called
Mrs. Youngberg after her. Gerty whirled, her cheeks
red, her eyes seeing not Mrs. Youngberg but a vision of
the kitchen at home; the unpeeled grapes, the candle-shades,
the waiting name-cards.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you were going to help me,” she
cried, her consternation shrilling her voice.</p>

<p>“I shall be right back,” reassured her friend. “You
may rely on me. Mr. Youngberg could not come in this
morning; he gave me a list a yard long. And I must see
Mrs. Blinn about the Improvement Club; it can’t be put
off. I’m not going to fail you. You may rely on me.”</p>

<p>It was really too provoking. The whole morning had
gone wrong. Mrs. Hardin marched into the hotel, her
color high. She might have guessed that Mrs. Youngberg
would fall down; she always did. She should have
relied on some one else, that homely Towne girl who is
always so good-natured!</p>

<p>Already ruffled, she found everything to be exasperating
in the Desert Hotel. She had taken it for granted
when Patton had promised her the use of the dining-room
weeks before that she could arrange the table as
she would use it at eleven. He upset all her plans by
telling her he needed the space; he had not intended to
give her that impression. She had said, he reminded her,
that she needed the room for an eleven o’clock supper.</p>

<p>She was convinced that she detected a difference in
his manner to her. “He would never have treated me so
last year. We are nobodies, now!”</p>

<p>The very best he could do, Mr. Patton assured her,
was to let her arrange the table in the drummers’
sample room whence it could be carried “all set” into
the dining-room after it was properly cleared. “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
to consider my girls,” he said. “If I ask them to do anything
extra, they would throw the whole waitresses’ union
in my face.”</p>

<p>“Give me a soda lemonade, Mr. Patton,” ordered
Gerty, moving to the white and silver counter. “I’ll
think it over.”</p>

<p>When she returned to the attack, he was still obstinately
fearful to antagonize the maids. “Servants are not
servants in California!” He led the way to the drummers’
room, where she had an inspiration.</p>

<p>“Let me have this room, Mr. Patton,” she urged. “It
will be so much cozier, and we can move the piano in,
and have music without it being so public as it is in the
hall.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mrs. Hardin, I’d like to accommodate you,
but there’s always drummers coming in here. There’s
sure to be one or more on that six o’clock train. It’s
right after supper they spread their samples.”</p>

<p>“Then they’d ruin my table!” cried Gerty.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’ll give them another table, Mrs. Hardin,”
protested Patton. “It’s the best I can do. I can’t afford
to lose their custom. You see, they pass it about, from
one place to the other, and if anything they don’t like
happens, the first thing your custom has fallen off.”</p>

<p>Haughtily, Gerty had to succumb. She found her next
block when she wished to bank the willow greens in the
dining-room. It lacked a few minutes to twelve. The
doors of the dining-room would be thrown open to the
patrons of the hotel; she compromised on vases. They
brought her a few small affairs which refused to stand
when filled with the top-heavy branches.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some crockery jugs in the kitchen,” Patton
volunteered. “I’ll have them washed and sent in to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“And I’m waiting for the cloth, Mr. Patton. None
of mine was long enough.”</p>

<p>Patton confessed that his were too short for the long
drummers’ table, but she could use two. No one would
ever see where they doubled in the center.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” cried Gerty Hardin. Her nerves were
on edge with the delay. She busied herself with unpacking
her bundles, listening for the sound of Mrs. Youngberg’s
buggy wheels. The table was fully set, the candle-shades
placed, the name-cards adjusted, even the willows
arranged as best she could in the gray crockery jugs
before Mrs. Youngberg returned.</p>

<p>She professed herself entranced with everything. And
where had she got the idea of those darling shades? The
green blotting-paper cut out stencil-wise in the design of
water lilies, the white paper lining making the petals,
was altogether charming and original. Would Mrs. Hardin
mind if she copied them?</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin’s answer was a little strained. “Of course,
I do not mind.” Mrs. Youngberg decided to use pink
and green when she made her copies; the white <i>was</i> a
little insipid! She was taking keen note of the arrangement
of the guests, of her husband’s name and Mrs. Hatfield’s,
side by side.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” inquired Mrs. Hardin, watching her
face. “It’s the hardest thing to place people, I think.”</p>

<p>Not for the world would Mrs. Youngberg have suggested
her annoyance. Every one put her husband next
to Mrs. Hatfield. He did not like that incorrigible coquette!
Every one knew by this time that rightfully she
was a grandmother. Her divorced husband was in a
remote background with the children and grandchildren.
The second husband was a minus, negative enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
maintain the tie which Mrs. Hatfield’s coquetry must put
under severe strain.</p>

<p>“Admirable,” said Mrs. Youngberg. She wondered if
Mrs. Hardin knew that a wind was rising? She would
not tell her. “Admirable,” she repeated.</p>

<p>Gerty’s eye casually observed every corner of the hall
as the two women made their way out. She wanted to
look at the register to see if Rickard’s name were there,
but her self-consciousness withheld her. He might see
her. Not until it was too late did she reflect that she
might have announced a curiosity as to new arrivals.
The street reached, she stared blankly at the wind-struck
town; then at Mrs. Youngberg.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a shame?” murmured her friend. “I hated to
tell you.”</p>

<p>Ready to cry was Gerty. Even the wind sided against
her party. It was blowing down the main street like
a baby hurricane with the colic. Her hat was wrenched
from its moorings.</p>

<p>“It’s not so bad as it used to be,” shrieked Mrs. Youngberg,
clambering into the buggy. “Before the alfalfa was
planted!”</p>

<p>The loungers had left the sidewalk. Up-stairs, the disheveled
chambermaids were making the beds in the overhanging
bird-cage. The street was deserted, save for the
Cocopahs who flanked the door of Eggers’ store like
bronze inscrutable sentinels. Two squaws came out to
watch the progress of the wind-blown buggy. Their
wide ruffled skirts were blown into balloons. Large
colored handkerchiefs, sewn together into a cloak, bellied
with the breeze. They watched the two white women
incuriously, steadily. Mrs. Youngberg was hanging on
to her Mexican sombrero with her left gauntleted hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Gerty was grabbing her pretty sun hat with her tired
fingers.</p>

<p>As they passed the bank, the workman was leaving his
job; the day was not propitious for gold-leaf. Two words
were completed, “The Desert.” The rest of the letters
were inconspicuous skeletons.</p>

<p>Gerty jumped out at her tent door. She would not
risk asking Mrs. Youngberg in. The unexpected might
happen.</p>

<p>“You are going just the same?” called Mrs. Youngberg,
her mouth full of dust.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin nodded. “Sure.” She ran in to her
wilting grapes.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE DRAGON TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE company’s automobile honked outside. Hardin
frowned across the table at his wife. “You’re
surely not going such a night as this?”</p>

<p>Gerty gave one of her light, elusive shrugs. No need
to answer Tom when he was in one of his black moods.
This was the first word he had spoken since he had
entered the tent. She had warned Innes by a lifted eyebrow—they
must be careful not to provoke him. Something
had gone wrong at the office, of course! How
much longer could she stand his humors, these ghastly
silent dinners?</p>

<p>“The river on a rampage, and we go for a drive!”
jeered Hardin.</p>

<p>The flood was not serious—yet! Tom loved to cry
“Wolf!” No one was alarmed in town—Patton, Mrs.
Youngberg, would have told her. Of course, one never
knew what that dreadful river would do next, but if one
had to wait always to see what the river’s next prank
would be, one would never get anywhere!</p>

<p>Innes was leaving the table. “Well, I suppose I should
be lashing on my hat!” Gerty’s pretty lips hardened as
the girl left the tent. These Hardins always loved to
spoil her enjoyment. They would like her to be a nun,
a cloistered nun!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>At the opening of the door, the wind tore the pictures
from the piano, wrenching the faded green mandarin
skirt which Gerty had brought from San Francisco. Her
sketches were flung to the floor. Gerty ran into her
room, shutting herself in against further argument. Tom
fastened the outer door, replacing the sketches that
stood for the sum and height of his wife’s several flights,
her separate career.</p>

<p>He was still staring through them, when his wife
came back into the room, powdered and heavily veiled
against the wind. A heavy winter ulster covered the
new mull gown which she had not worn at supper, though
Innes could have helped her with the hooks! But there
was always so much talk about everything!</p>

<p>They had to face the gale as the machine swept down
the wind-crazed street. “Never saw such a blow in all
the time I’ve been here,” yelled Wooster over his wheel
to Hardin.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. MacLean?” Gerty leaned over from the
back seat where she had been huddling. She felt awkwardly
conscious of not having invited Wooster. She
did not have any other reason for excluding him, except
that she did not meet him at the other houses. Still, if
Rickard were not coming—they would be short a man.</p>

<p>“He had some work to finish—he asked me to take
out the machine,” called Wooster without turning. The
dust was blinding him.</p>

<p>“He’s probably coming later!” cried Gerty to Innes,
and then she huddled in her corner again. It was easier
not to talk; one had to scream to be heard.</p>

<p>It was too bad to have a night like this! And all her
work—Tom and his sister would have it go for nothing!
She was made of stubborner stuff than that. Life had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
been dealing out mean hands to her, but she would not
drop out of the game, acknowledge herself beaten—luck
would turn, she would get better cards. To-night she
was tired. It had been a hard scrambling day. Several
times she could have cried. Sam was so stupid, she
could not make him understand where he was to leave
things at the hotel—if anything happened to those shades,
or to that salad!</p>

<p>In the hall of the Desert Hotel, the party was assembling.
Mr. and Mrs. Blinn were already the center
of a group, flinging matrimonial volleys. Innes could
hear Blinn’s loud voice as she entered the door: “That
was before we were married. Now, it’s very different.
That’s what matrimony does.” Every one knew they
covered their devotion with chronic jeers. She steered
toward another corner where the Wilsons held court.</p>

<p>“Too bad, isn’t it?” Mrs. Youngberg advanced toward
Gerty, who was looking for Rickard. She did not
like to ask if he had come.</p>

<p>Howard Blinn broke off to greet his hostess. “You
saved our lives by being a little late,” he exclaimed.
“Our dinner was late. It’s always late, since the Improvement
Club was organized!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin’s roving eye scoured the hall. Rickard
was not there. Patton called her from the desk. Some
one wanted her at the telephone. It was Rickard, of
course, at the office; to say he had been detained. The
fear which had been chilling her passed by.</p>

<p>It was not Rickard on the wire, but Mrs. Hatfield,
loquacious and coquettish. She urged a frightful neuralgia,
and hoped that she was not putting her hostess
to any inconvenience at this last moment. She wanted
to prolong the conversation—had the guests all come?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Were they <i>really</i> going? Then she must be getting old,
for a night like this dismayed her! Gerty felt her good
night was rudely abrupt. But was she to stand there
gabbling all night, her guests waiting?</p>

<p>She prayed that Rickard would be there when she returned.
What a travesty if the guest of honor should
disappoint her! Though he was not among the different
groups, her confidence in his punctiliousness reassured
her. She must hold them a little longer. She
flitted gaily from one standing group to another; she
outtalked the jolly Blinns. Her eyes constantly questioned
the clock.</p>

<p>“How long are you going to wait for Mrs. Hatfield?”
Her husband came up, protesting.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hatfield,” she explained distantly, “is not coming.
We are waiting for Mr. Rickard.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t come in on that train; he’s at the Heading.”
Hardin added something about trouble at the intake,
but Gerty did not heed. Tom had known and had
not told her when there was yet time to call it off!</p>

<p>“A pretty time to tell me!” Had he been looking at
her, he would have been left no illusions. Her blue eyes
flashed hate.</p>

<p>“I did not know it until we got here. There was a
message from MacLean at the desk, waiting.”</p>

<p>MacLean was not there, either!</p>

<p>“Quarreling?” cried Blinn, drawing nearer. “I must
separate husband and wife. Depend upon me to take
your part, Mrs. Hardin.”</p>

<p>A heroic smile answered him. A joke, that!</p>

<p>“We are all ready,” she cried. “Mrs. Hatfield and Mr.
Rickard can not come.” Not for worlds would she give
in to her desire to call the whole grim affair off; let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
them think she was disappointed, not she. Though the
world blew away, she would go.</p>

<p>She found herself distributing slips of mangled quotations.
The white slips went to the women; the green
bits of pasteboard to the men. She held a certain green
card in her glove: “Leads on to fortune.” Rickard
might come dashing in at the last moment, the ideal
man’s way; a special, perhaps; it did not seem credible
that he would deliberately stay away without sending her
word.</p>

<p>“I’ve drawn my own wife!” cried Blinn, with exaggerated
ruefulness.</p>

<p>Youngberg was moving through the groups. He
could not find his half-quotation. “Who has the rest of
this?” he was demanding.</p>

<p>Gerty read it over his shoulder. “Gang aft a-gley. Oh,
the best laid schemes. That’s Miss Wilson.”</p>

<p>In a burst of laughter, the company discovered then
that the guest of honor was also absent. Mrs. Hardin
hurried them out to the waiting buggies.</p>

<p>When she had seated the chattering crowd, Gerty discovered
that Tom had drawn Mrs. Hatfield, and was
planning a desertion. Blankly, they faced each other.
“Well, let’s get it over.” His words sounded brutal to
his wife, whose nerves were flayed by the day’s vexations.
Drearily, they drove together down the flying
street. The wind was at their backs, but it tore at their
hats, pulled at their tempers. Their eyes were full of
street dust. Through the gloom, they could see the two
finished words gleaming from the plate-glass windows of
the bank: “The Desert.” Even dull imaginations could
get that prophecy—the town blotted out by flying sand;
The Desert come again into its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>A flash of light as they were leaving town brightened
the thick dust-clouds. “What was that?” cried Gerty.
She was ready for any calamity now. “Not lightning?”
Again, the queer light flashed across the obscured sky.
Tom roused himself to growl that he hadn’t seen anything.
And the dreary farce went on.</p>

<p>Innes’ partner was young Sutcliffe, the English zanjero.
He was in the quicksand of a comparison between
English and American women, Innes mischievously coaxing
him into deeper waters, when there was a blockade
of buggies ahead of them.</p>

<p>“The A B C ranch,” cried Innes, peering through the
veil of dust at the queer unreal outlines of fences and
trees. “It’s our first stop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, that’s too bad,” began Sutcliffe. Innes
was already on the road, her skirts whipped by the wind
into clinging drapery.</p>

<p>Gerty’s party found itself disorganized. Partners
were trying to find or lose each other. “Get in here!”
Innes heard the voice of Estrada behind her. He had a
top buggy. She hailed a refuge.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” she cried. “What a relief!” Climbing
in, she said: “I hope this isn’t upsetting Gerty’s arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Arrangement! Look at them!” The women were
hastening out of the dust swirl into any haven that
offered. With little screams of dismay, they ran like
rabbits to cover.</p>

<p>Gerty found herself with Blinn. At the next stop,
there was a block of buggies. “No use changing again!”
She acknowledged herself beaten. “Let’s go on. What
are they stopping for?” Dismal farce it all was!</p>

<p>She was pushing back her disheartened curls when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the beat of horses’ hoofs back of them brought the blood
back into her wind-chilled cheeks. “Rickard!” she
thought. “He must have come in a special!” The gloom
suddenly disgorged MacLean.</p>

<p>“Hardin! Where is he?”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” yelled Blinn. “Is it the river?” MacLean’s
face answered him. His ranch scoured again—“God
Almighty!”</p>

<p>“The river!” screamed the women. The men were
surrounding MacLean, whose horse was prancing as if
with the importance of having carried a Revere. “The
levee!” called MacLean. “Where’s Hardin?” He
spurred his mare toward Hardin, who was blacker than
Napoleon at Austerlitz.</p>

<p>“You’re needed. They’re all needed.” The other
voices broke in, the men pressing up. This threatened
them all. Blinn’s ranch lay in the ravaged sixth district.
Nothing would save him. Youngberg belonged to Water
Company Number One; their ditches would go. Hollister
and Wilson, of the Palo Verde, saw ruin ahead of them.
Each man was visualizing the mad onward sweep of that
destroying power. Like ghosts, the women huddled in
the dust-blown road.</p>

<p>“Where is it now?” demanded Blinn.</p>

<p>“It’s here, right on us. You’re all needed at the levee,”
bawled MacLean.</p>

<p>The levee! There was a dash for buggies, a scraping
of wheels, the whinnying of frightened horses. Some
one recalled the flashes of light they had seen on leaving
town. “What were those lights—signals?”</p>

<p>“From the water-tower.” MacLean’s voice split the
wind. “The wires are all down between the Crossing
and the towns. Coronel was on the tower—he got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
signal from the Heading—he’s been there each night for
a week!” This was a great night—for his chief, Rickard!</p>

<p>Gerty Hardin caught the thrill of his hero-worship.
How splendid, how triumphant!</p>

<p>Innes found herself in her brother’s buggy. His
horse, under the whip, dashed forward. Suddenly he
pulled it back on its haunches, narrowly averting a jam.
“Where’s MacLean?”</p>

<p>The boy rode back. “Who’s calling me?”</p>

<p>“Give me your horse,” demanded Hardin. “You take
my sister home.”</p>

<p>Gerty Hardin’s party was torn like a bow of useless
finery. Facing the wind now, no one could talk; no
one wanted to talk. Each was threshing out his own
thoughts; personal ruin stared them in the face. Every
man was remembering that reckless exposed cut of Hardin’s;
pinning their hope to that ridiculed levee. The
horses broke into a reckless gallop, the buggies lurching
wildly as they dodged one another. The axles creaked
and strained. The wind tore away the hats of the women,
rent their pretty chiffon veils.</p>

<p>The dusty road was peopled with dark formless shapes.
The signals had spread the alarm; the desert world was
flocking to the gorge of the New River, to the levee.
Gerty was swept past the stores which had gaped at her
in the morning. Coulter’s was deserted. At Fred Eggers’,
a candle flickered behind a green curtain. Gerty
could see the half finished sign on the plate-glass windows
of the bank. “The Desert” shone wanly at her.</p>

<p>The women were dumped without ceremony on the
sidewalk, under the screened bird-cage of the Desert
Hotel. Shivering, her pretty teeth chattering, Gerty
Hardin ushered them into the deserted hall. The Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
cook snored away his vigil in an armchair by the open
fire. The men had rushed away to the levee.</p>

<p>“Women must wait,” Gerty’s laugh was hysterical.
“We can do no good down there.” She threw herself,
conscious of heroineship, into the ordeal of her spoilt
entertainment.</p>

<p>It was always an incoherent dream to Innes Hardin,
that wild ride homeward, the lurching scraping buggies,
the apprehensive silence, this huddling of women like
scared rabbits around a table that had else been gay.
The women’s teeth shivered over the ices. Their faces
looked ghastly by the light shed by Gerty’s green shades.
She wished she were at the levee. She simply must go
to the levee. “I’m going to get a wrap,” she threw to
Gerty as she passed. “I left it in the hall.”</p>

<p>She stole through the deserted office, past the white
and silver soda fountain, and out into the speeding blur
of the night. Formless shapes, soft footed, passed her.
As she sped past the French windows of the dining-room
she could get a view of the shattered party. The
candles were glittering; some overzealous maid had
lighted them when the table was carried into the dining-room.
No others could be found. The Chinese cook was
that instant entering with a large lamp backed by a tin reflector.
Mrs. Youngberg was huddled in her fur cape.
A sight to laugh over, when it became a memory! The
eyes of several of the women were visualizing ruin, Mrs.
Blinn among them. The others wore sleepy masks.</p>

<p>Innes made a dive into the darkness. There was a
dim outline of hastening figures in front of her. She
could hear some one breathing heavily by her side. They
kept apace, stumbling, occasionally, the moving gloom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
betraying their feet. A man came running back toward
the town. “It’s cutting back!” He cried. “Nothing but
the levee will save the towns!”</p>

<p>The levee!</p>

<p>The harsh breathing followed her. As they passed
the wretched hut of a Mexican gambler, a sputtering
light shone out. Innes looked back. She saw the wrinkled
face of Coronel, who had left his water-tower. His
black coarse hair was streaming in the wind, his mouth,
ajar, was expressionless, though the fulfilment of the
Great Prophecy was at hand. Beneath the cheek-splotches
of green and red paint rested a curious dignity.
The Indian was to come again into his own.</p>

<p>What was his own, she questioned, as her feet stumbled
over loosened boarding, a ditch crossing she had not
seen. More corn, perhaps more fiery stuff to wash down
the corn! More white man’s money in the brown man’s
pocket—that, his happiness. Why should he not thank
the gods? His gods were speaking! For when the
waters of the great river ran back to the desert, the
long ago outraged gods were no longer angry. The
towns might go, but the great Indian gods were showing
their good will!</p>

<p>She joined a group at the levee, winding her veil over
mouth and forehead. Dark shapes swayed near her. The
wind was making havoc of the mad waters rushing down
from the channel. The noise of wind and waters was
appalling. Strange loud voices came through the din,
of Indians, Mexicans; guttural sounds. Men ran past
her, carrying shovels, pulling sacks of sand; lanterns,
blown dim, flashed their pale light on her chilled cheeks.</p>

<p>Not even the levee, she knew then, would save the
towns. This was the end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>ON THE LEVEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARDIN did not go home that night. He was feeling
to the quick the irony of his position; his
duty now to protect the levee he’d ridiculed; now the
only hope of the towns! The integrity of the man never
faltered, though his thoughts ran wild. Like the relentless
hounds of Actæon, they pursued him, barking
at his vanity.</p>

<p>He started the anxious ranchers at sacking sand.
Bodefeldt ran up to tell him that there was a hill of filled
sacks over in Mexicali. “Rickard had a bunch of Indians
working for a week.”</p>

<p>The confusion of the shy fellow did not escape Hardin.
Oh, he knew what Bodefeldt was thinking, what
every one was saying! They were all laughing at him.
The coincidence of this extraordinary flood had upheld
Rickard’s wild guess, haloed his judgment. It was all
a piece of his infernal luck. Sickening, that’s what it
was! His orders scattered. He ran up and down the
levee, giving orders; recalling them when he found he
was repeating Rickard’s.</p>

<p>This new humiliation, coming on the heels of the
dredge fiasco, put him in execrable temper. He shouted
his orders over the noises of the night. He rated the
men, bullied them. No one did anything right! Lord,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
what he had to put up with! The other men, the ranchers
and engineers, saw in his excitement certainty of
the valley’s doom.</p>

<p>The wind and the darkness contributed to the confusion.
Eager shovels were tossing up earth before any
one could tell where the danger point would be. The
water was not yet high enough to determine the place
of battle. Sacked sand was being brought over from
Mexicali. Fifty pair of hands made short work of Rickard’s
“Hill.” Lanterns were flashing through the darkness
like restless fireflies. The wind and rushing water
deadened the sound of the voices. It was a battle of
giants against pygmies. In the darkness, the giants
threatened to conquer.</p>

<p>At three in the morning, a horseman rode in from
Fassett’s, one of the big ranches to the north, cut by the
New River.</p>

<p>“The river is cutting back,” he called through the din,
“cutting back toward the towns.”</p>

<p>A turn in the gorge, a careless dump-pit had pulled
the river like a mad horse back on its haunches. It
was kicking back.</p>

<p>“They are short-handed up there. They need help.”</p>

<p>“Dynamite,” cried Silent and Hardin antiphonally.
They happened to be standing near.</p>

<p>“We must have dynamite,” bawled Hardin. “Are the
wires down between here and Brawley? We must get
a wire somehow to Los Angeles, to rush it down here
this morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s here. There is a carload on the siding,” yelled
Silent.</p>

<p>Hardin did not need to ask by whose orders it was
there. An angry scowl spoiled his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Put some on the machine.” He was turning away.</p>

<p>Silent called after him. Did Mr. Hardin think it was
safe? There was no road between the towns and Fassett’s.
The night, the explosive,—should they not wait
till morning? The question threw his late chief into a
rage.</p>

<p>“Did I ask you to take it?” It was the opening for
his fury. “Safe! Will the towns be safe if the river
cuts back here? The channel has got to be widened, and
you talk of your own precious skin! Wait till I ask you
to take it. Get out the machine. I’ll take it to Fassett’s
myself.”</p>

<p>Silent left the levee, smarting. As he fumbled for the
lanterns hanging in the shed where the machine was
stalled, he lived over those last few years; with Hardin
in the desert. When had he ever hesitated over a
risk of life? When had he thought of his own safety?
But this was a foolhardy thing, no matter who took the
machine. Daylight would be here in a few hours. The
way to Fassett’s, through the ravaged country, was
scarred by other floods. There was a half-mile of levee
to be covered; a ticklish thing by day to carry a machine
over the narrow mound, scraping bottom all the
time. By night—with dynamite in the bumping tonneau
it was a gamble—and the wind blowing like this. But
he wouldn’t let Hardin take it, he would show Hardin
what he meant by “safe”!</p>

<p>By the pale flicker of the single lantern he got out
the long gray car, nosed like a hound, filled the tank
with oil, the canteens with water from a filter in the
adjoining shop. He backed the machine out of the shed
and sped through the darkness toward Mexicali, where
the car of explosives was isolated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>He went over his grievance while he handled the
dangerous stuff. The boss was taking chances; that was
what he meant. He was not afraid of danger. Afraid!</p>

<p>Hardin, buttoned up to the ears, his soft hat pulled
tight over his forehead, was waiting impatiently. Here
was something to be done; he coveted the activity.</p>

<p>“I thought you were never coming,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Let me take it!” pleaded the engineer.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, there is no danger.” Hardin saw personal
affection in the plea. He put his hand affectionately
on the man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“But you are needed here.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is not here; it won’t be either, if we blow
out the channel. Here, jump out.”</p>

<p>“I want to go.” Silent kept a stubborn hold on the
steering gear. He felt Hardin’s place was at the levee.</p>

<p>“You go home and catch a nap; this is my job.” He
was standing on the step. “Crank her.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for Silent to do but to get out.
Hardin pointed the long nose of the car into the darkness.
She was off like the greyhound she suggested,
missing a telegraph pole by half an inch.</p>

<p>“Just like him,” mused Silent. “The slimmest margins,
the biggest chances, that’s Tom Hardin.” The
touch on the shoulder had dispelled his grouch.</p>

<p>“Just like Hardin to insist on carrying the dynamite
to Fassett’s.” Spectacular, maybe, like all of his impulses,
but splendid and fearless as the man himself.
“He never knows when he is beaten,” glowed the engineer.
“If this valley ever comes into its own, it will be
because of Tom Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Who is in charge here?” a woman’s voice was piercing
the racket of wind and wave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>The dawn was breaking. Down the New River he
could see the wind whipping the water into white-capped
fury. “Vicious,” he muttered. “Those heavy waves
play the Old Harry with the levee.”</p>

<p>“Where is my brother?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hardin!” cried Silent.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded Innes. Her hair streamed
away from her face. Her cheeks were blanched. Her
yellow eyes, peering into the dusk, looked owlish. Her
wind-spanked skirts clung to her limbs. To Silent she
looked boyish, as though clipped and trousered. “Where
is my brother?” she repeated.</p>

<p>Silent told her without reservations where he had gone
and why. There was no feminine foolishness about that
sister of Hardin’s. A chip of the old block. Funny, the
men all thought of her as Hardin’s daughter on account
of the difference of age. As to a comrade, proudly,
he bragged of the taking of the dynamite over that roadless
waste.</p>

<p>“Whom did he leave in his place?” She did not see
him shake his head. “I want George Whitaker to be
sent home. He is coughing his head off down the levee,
he is wet to the skin; he was being doctored for pneumonia
a week ago.”</p>

<p>Silent knew, only, that he himself was not in charge!
Hardin had ordered him to bed.</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Estrada?” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“He is not here, he went down the road to look after
the track. Hardin went off in such a hurry, I guess he
told nobody,” chuckled the engineer, still glowing.</p>

<p>“Then I’m it!” cried Innes Hardin. “Will you take
my orders, Silent?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” he chuckled again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Send George Whitaker home. And not to report
till to-morrow morning. Say Hardin said so. You
needn’t say which Hardin.”</p>

<p>She pinned up her blown hair, the wind fighting her.
Her thoughts would accuse Tom! Perhaps the apparent
confusion was all well ordered; perhaps this was the way
men worked when the need was desperate, when homes
were at stake! Yet, there was Tom racing across the
country when a lieutenant would have done as well.
Was he losing his grip? The earthquake episode had
frightened her. She knew he lacked discipline, of school,
and gentle home-training. The struggle with the wilderness
had absorbed his parents. She knew he was oversanguine,
careless of details, careless of the means to his
ends. Perhaps it was because she was a woman, and
fearful, and saw things in a womanish way. Perhaps
all strong men, men who achieved great results, attacked
them as Tom did. The daring chance, for Tom always.
A corner to be turned, he must always take the sharpest
curve. If he were as reckless with other people’s lives
as he was with his own—</p>

<p>The voice of Silent was in her ear. “He is gone. I’ve
sent him home.”</p>

<p>The yellow eyes gleamed prankishly in the half light.
“Will you take more orders from me, Silent?”</p>

<p>“You’re the captain!”</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Dowker down there. His wife is sick.
Send him home, say Hardin said so.”</p>

<p>She called after him; “Parrish, too, if you can find
him!”</p>

<p>She watched the white-capped waves break into harmless
spray against the levee. A little higher, and those
waves would not be harmless. If the wind kept up, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
those waters rose—ah, these men would be needing their
strength to-night!</p>

<p>The dawn was creeping in like a laggard culprit. The
whitecaps caught the light, scattering it as foam. The
flashing lanterns grew pale; Innes could discern some
of the faces. She saw Coronel wrapped in a gray blanket,
squatting on the newly-raised bank. His unbound hair
slapped his old weathered mask. “The map of the desert
furrowed on his face,” Captain Brandon had once
said. She wrapped her coat around her head.</p>

<p>Silent came back. “Dowker’s gone, I couldn’t find
Parrish.” He cut his words off with a click, for through
the rush of the wind and water came the whistle of a
locomotive.</p>

<p>“A special!” cried Silent. Hardin’s sister and his
friend looked at each other, the same thought in mind:
Rickard, in from the Heading!</p>

<p>On her face Silent saw the same spectacular impulse
which had flashed over Hardin’s features a short time
before.</p>

<p>She put her hand on his arm. “Silent, you’re his
friend. Straighten this out. We can’t have him come
back—spying—and find this.” She waved her hand toward
the disorganized groups.</p>

<p>“I’d take more orders,” suggested the engineer.</p>

<p>“Then send a third of them home, tell them to come
back to-night at six. Send away the other third, tell
them to come back at noon. Keep the other shift. Say
you’ll have coffee sent from the hotel, tell them Hardin
says to stop wasting stuff. Tell them, oh, tell them
anything you can think of, Silent, before he comes.”
Her breakdown was girlish.</p>

<p>She could hear the signal of the locomotive; coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
closer. Then she could hear the pant of the engine as
it worked up the grade. It was a steady gentle climb
all the way from the Junction, two hundred feet below
sea-level, to the towns resting at the level of the sea. It
quickened her thought of the power of the river. Nothing
between it and the tracks at Salton. Nothing to
stop its flow into that spectacular new sea whose
basin did not need a drop of the precious misguided flow.
She could hear the bells; now the train was coming into
the station; she would not wait for Silent. She did not
want to meet Rickard.</p>

<p>No one saw her as she left the levee. She passed
Silent, who was issuing orders. She heard him say,
“The boss says so.”</p>

<p>She took the road by the railroad sheds, to avoid the
dismissed shifts, moving townward. At full speed, she
collided with a man, rounding the sheds’ corner. It was
Rickard. Her veil had slipped to her shoulders and he
saw her face.</p>

<p>“Miss Hardin!” he exclaimed. “Whatever are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“I was looking for my brother.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to be out at night alone here.”</p>

<p>“It’s morning!”</p>

<p>“With every Indian in the country coming in. I’ll
send Parrish with you.”</p>

<p>She recognized Parrish behind him. She tried to tell
him that she knew every Indian in Mexicali, every Mexican
in the twin towns, but he would not listen to her.
“I’m not going to let you go home alone.”</p>

<p>She blinked rebellion at the supplanter of her brother.
But she found herself following Parrish. She took a
deep pride in her independence, her fearlessness. Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
let her go where she liked. She had an impulse to dismiss
Parrish; every man was needed, but he would obey
Rickard’s orders. MacLean had told her that! “They
don’t like him, but they mind him!”</p>

<p>Rickard made his way down to the levee. “Where
is Hardin?” he asked of every one he met. The answer
came pointing in the direction where Innes had stood.</p>

<p>He made a swift inspection. It was not so bad as he
had feared. Orders had scattered in the night; but it
might have been worse.</p>

<p>Silent came up to explain that Hardin had gone up
to Fassett’s just a few minutes ago to carry dynamite.
The river was cutting back there. “Good,” cried Rickard,
“that’s bully!”</p>

<p>“He left me in charge,” glibly lied the friend of Hardin.
“Any orders, sir?”</p>

<p>“Things are going all right?” began the manager. He
stopped. From above came a dull roar.</p>

<p>“Dynamite!” cried Rickard.</p>

<p>The friend of Hardin had nothing to say. “I thought
you said he went only a few minutes ago?” demanded
his chief.</p>

<p>There was another detonation. Down the river came
the booming of the second charge.</p>

<p>“That’s dynamite for sure,” evaded Silent.</p>

<p>“Not a minute too soon!” declared Rickard, going
back to his inspection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE WHITE REFUGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE town woke to a matter-of-fact day. The sensational
aspect of the runaway river had passed with
the night. The word spread that the flood waters were
under control; that the men had gone home to sleep,
so the women got breakfast as usual, and tidied their
homes. The Colorado was always breaking out, like a
naughty child from school. Never would the cry of
“The river!” fail to drag the blood from their cheeks.
But relief always came; the threatened danger was always
averted, and these pioneer women had acquired
the habit of swift reaction.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Mrs. Youngberg was to entertain at
the A B C ranch the ladies of the Improvement Club.
It was a self-glorification meeting, to celebrate the planting
of trees in the streets of Calexico, and to plan the
campaign of their planting. Mrs. Blinn drove into town
to get Gerty Hardin. Neither woman had seen her
husband since the interrupted drive the night before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I should go,” Mrs. Hardin
hesitated, her face turned toward the A B C ranch.
“Perhaps there is something we could do.”</p>

<p>“I have just come from the levee.” Mrs. Blinn’s
jolly face had lost its apprehension. “The water has
not risen an inch since breakfast. Most of the men have
been sent home. When Howard didn’t come home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
lunch, I grew anxious. But Mr. Rickard says he sent
him to Fassett’s with more dynamite.”</p>

<p>“Dynamite!” shuddered Gerty. “Aren’t you terribly
afraid?” So Rickard was in town! Her breath fluttered.
Strange, how her spirits rose!</p>

<p>Mrs. Blinn wondered if the wife was the only person
in the town who had not heard of Hardin’s melodramatic
ride that morning. She decided that the story
had been purposely withheld. She would not be the one
to inform her.</p>

<p>“Would you mind—” Gerty laid a well-kept hand on
her friend’s knee. “Would you mind turning back? I’d
be more <i>comfortable</i> if I could see Tom or Mr. Rickard;
hear what they think about it.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Rickard told me,” began Mrs. Blinn.</p>

<p>“I’m worried about Tom,” cried Gerty, flushing.
Danger to Tom was a new thought. With Rickard in
town the levee beckoned irresistibly. Were it Mrs.
Youngberg, with her sharp eyes, or Innes, she would not
dare, but Mrs. Blinn was dull; she would never suspect
anything!</p>

<p>Mrs. Blinn’s devotion to her husband, who was the
butt of her fond ridicule, and the center of her universe,
made her believe all women like herself. Gerty’s high
color, she thought, meant anxiety.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll turn back.”</p>

<p>“There he is,” thrilled Gerty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blinn’s eye swept the street. “Where? Your
husband?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Rickard. Passing the bank. There, he’s
stopped. I wonder if he is going in? You call him,
Mrs. Blinn.”</p>

<p>Obediently her friend hailed Rickard. He turned back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
to the windy street. He felt boyish: the crisis was giving
him mercurial feet. He loved the modern battle.
Elements to pit one’s brains against, wits against force!</p>

<p>Gerty Hardin’s face was flushing and paling. “The
river,” she faltered. “Should we be alarmed, Mr. Rickard?”</p>

<p>Smiling, he assured her she should not be alarmed;
the levees would protect the towns.</p>

<p>She found it hard to meet his eyes; they had always
made her conscious in the old Lawrence days. They
suggested controlled amusement, a critical detachment.
She used to hunt for the cause. Now she was experienced,
yet his smile still gave her that old hampered
sense of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“She is anxious about her husband,” Mrs. Blinn had
to explain. Gerty bit her lip. What a parrot Mrs. Blinn
was!</p>

<p>“Mr. Hardin is up at Fassett’s ranch, he will be coming
back to-day. I told your husband, Mrs. Blinn, to catch
a nap and then relieve Mr. Hardin.”</p>

<p>Gerty found a significance in his words, he had said
“Mr. Hardin,” and “your husband, Mrs. Blinn.” It was
enough to weave dreams around.</p>

<p>“A nap,” exclaimed Mrs. Blinn, “why, he didn’t come
home.”</p>

<p>“I think I saw him go into the men’s quarters.” Distinctly
Rickard had heard Blinn’s jolly voice as he had
left the levee: “If I’m to catch a nap, I’ll not go home.
No sleeping there!”</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything, Mr. Rickard, to help?” urged
Gerty Hardin, her voice tremulous.</p>

<p>“I hope we won’t have to call on you at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>There was no excuse to linger. Gerty threw a wistful
little smile at parting.</p>

<p>The brown mare’s head was turned toward the country.
Rickard turned back to the bank.</p>

<p>He looked again at the plate-glass windows. Two
words were finished, The Desert, brilliant in gold-leaf.
The rest of the sign still stood in its dim skeleton!
Boyish mischievous blood raced in his veins that morning.
He went in.</p>

<p>“Mr. Petrie in?” he asked the cashier. Young Oliver
said he was not. “He is tying vines to-day.”</p>

<p>“When are you going to finish that window?”</p>

<p>“Why, after this flood, I guess, Mr. Rickard.” The
question was unexpected. Every one knew Casey now
by sight. The cashier glanced at his tie. Casey had
forgotten his pin that morning.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looked to me. There is too much
desert in this town, <i>Desert</i> Hotel, <i>Desert</i> Reclamation
Company, and now this—The Desert! If you would
only put ‘<i>bank</i>’ on it! It looks as though you thought
you were going to be washed out, as if you were saving
your gold-leaf. A bank has got to keep up a bold front,
if it’s only plate-glass, Mr. Cashier.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” called young Oliver. “Wait a minute,
Mr. Rickard. I guess you did not understand what I
meant. There is no one to finish this lettering! The man
who was doing it owns a ranch over in Wistaria. He
is the only man who can do it. He is down at the river,
fighting to save his crop.”</p>

<p>“Then I’d finish it myself,” said Rickard, “or get some
one down from Los Angeles who could,” and left the
bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>A sign hanging from a neighboring door, “For Sail,”
caught his eye.</p>

<p>The owner of the store peered out at the group of
giggling Indians. “Fried Eggs,” as the irreverent young
engineers had dubbed him, waved them away from an
empty crate. It was not a bad simile, thought Rickard,
smiling at the orange-colored mop which crowned the
albumen-like whiteness of the house-bleached face of
Fred Eggers. He stopped to watch the man’s queer
antics. From shelf to counter he bounced, an anxious
eye on his open crate on the platform where the group
of covetous squaws and bucks encroached. Rickard was
vastly amused. Eggers waddled out of the door, obscured
by his bales of brilliant calico. He waved back
the Indians. He threw his bundle into the crate, and
sidled into the store for another load, his eyes still challenging
the Indians. His distress was comical. They
were his best customers; he must not drive them away,
but he could not trust them. He snatched up a bolt of
blue and white gingham, and was back on the platform.
“Stand back, stand back,” he urged. “Don’t you see that
you are in my way?”</p>

<p>They giggled maddeningly.</p>

<p>The man’s distress was maudlin. He jumped sidewise
into his store, picking up his scattered stock by finger
sense only, his eyes riveted on the squaws. Haste, concern,
were written all over the corpulent unwieldy body,
in the unlined pasty face of “Fried Eggs.”</p>

<p>“Moving away, Mr. Eggers?” Rickard called out to
him.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since he had been dignified by
that name. He turned to answer, and in that instant a
swarthy Amazon snatched a small roll of turkey red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
calico, and hid it under her amply ruffled skirt. He did
not see his loss.</p>

<p>“I’m getting ready to move if I have to. The river
don’t look good to me, that’s sure.” He shot a quick
glance of suspicion at the blank-faced Indians, snickering
by the door. The bucks had brilliant bandannas
wound around their mud-crusted heads. The black stiff
hair of the women streamed in the wind which puffed
their skirts into balloons.</p>

<p>“It cost me three thousand, the lot, the shop and the
stock. I’d take a thousand.”</p>

<p>“I’d give you that,” Rickard began roguishly.</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Fred Eggers.</p>

<p>“<i>But</i>,” objected the newcomer, “it would be taking
a mean advantage of you. You’re playing sure to lose.”</p>

<p>Eggers sat on the edge of his crate and looked at
the man who had said he would give him a thousand
for his goods.</p>

<p>“If you stay and the river ruins your stock you will
probably save your store; you’ll surely keep your lot.”
Eggers shook his head. “You’ll probably lose nothing,
the water is not coming up here. If you sell to me,
for a thousand, or to any one else you’re fixed to lose
two. Oh, stay and bluff it, Eggers.”</p>

<p>So it was only a joke, then. “You won’t buy it,”
the house-whitened face was crestfallen.</p>

<p>“You won’t sell, if you take time to think it over,”
called Rickard, moving on.</p>

<p>Eggers felt something moving behind him. A squaw
drew back from the crate. One hand was lost under
her flowing cloak of gaudy colored handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>“Stop that,” he yelled. “Here you Indians, vamose.
D’ye hear me? Vamose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The group of Indians drew back but only a few
steps, giggling. The sidling motion began again. Rickard,
laughing, looked over his shoulder at Eggers’ absurd
dilemma.</p>

<p>On the morning-glory-covered veranda of the adobe
offices of the Desert Reclamation Company, Ogilvie was
waiting.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking everywhere for you, Mr. Rickard.”
His tone was sepulchral and foreboding.</p>

<p>“It’s a big place, the towns. Hard to find any one,
unless it’s an accident.” He made for his office, followed
by Ogilvie. Rickard, who had had two hours of
sleep, felt refreshed and rollicking. This was some fun!
These dismal fearful citizens! He and Marshall would
show them what a railroad force could do!</p>

<p>He threw himself into his swivel chair and looked up
at the expert accountant whose blue-veined hands were
describing circles with his straw hat.</p>

<p>“I think,” plunged Ogilvie, “that this is no place for
the papers of the company.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“They ought to be in Los Angeles,” stammered the
accountant, forgetting his speech.</p>

<p>“If I’m not mistaken, you persuaded them contrarily
a few months ago!”</p>

<p>Ogilvie squirmed. “Oh, but the flood,”—his pallid
skin showed a flexibility that almost suggested animation.
“That alters everything.”</p>

<p>“The flood? Why, I think we can fix that.”</p>

<p>“I may go?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not say you might go. I agree with you
that the papers belong here, where we may have easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
access to them instead of having to go to Los Angeles
every time we want to have a question of history or
authority answered.”</p>

<p>The man whose woozling had come to nothing cleared
his throat. “This office is not safe—”</p>

<p>“I said I’d fix that.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to write to Los Angeles, telling them about
the flood. The wires are down—”</p>

<p>“You don’t need authority from Los Angeles. I’ll
fix you up. You know that rise, east of the town?
Back of the school? I’ll have a tent rigged up there—”</p>

<p>“The wind,” objected the accountant.</p>

<p>“The wind won’t hurt the papers. I’ll send up a safe
and a bed.”</p>

<p>“A safe suggests money, valuables—the Indians!” murmured
Ogilvie.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a gun.” Rickard was enjoying himself.
The fellow was a driveling coward. MacLean’s word
fitted him like a glove: woozling!</p>

<p>That afternoon Rickard was not too busy to order
a tent stretched on the rise back of the schoolhouse.
It was not all mischief! The office building might go!
A safe was lugged across town. Ogilvie dismally bossed
the proceedings. The platform must be tight; he mentioned
snakes. He wanted a spider, but there was neither
lumber nor men to spare; he spoke of wind-storms. He
wanted double doors, one of screen wire; he had a good
deal to say about flies.</p>

<p>Toward evening an iron bed was hauled to the tent
which the younger engineers, fresh from their day’s
rest, had spied and already christened the White Refuge.
Ogilvie showed the two impassive Mexicans why it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
should be placed so that his feet pointed north; he explained
thoroughly about magnetic currents. There, they
left him, with his papers.</p>

<p>The disappointed tenant of the White Refuge sat
down on the foot of his bed, and dismally reviewed
the situation. The hurried platform of the tent was
creaking ominously. The canvas walls sagged and
strained against the wind. He rehearsed the situation.</p>

<p>The burning of San Francisco had flooded the southern
part of the state with clerks and accountants; to
Los Angeles they had come in droves. He could not
leave the towns, defying Rickard, and expect to find
another place with the Overland Pacific Company. He
wished, in deep gloom, that he had not bought those
hundred shares in the smaller organization. It had appeared
to him as a crowning bit of diplomacy, and put
him, he thought, on the same basis as the directors,
Hardin, Gifford and the others. But it had left him
strapped. He had had to borrow to make up the hundred
shares. He had only just paid that debt. The
Desert Bank held less than fifty dollars to his credit.
That sum between him and poverty! He decided to
brave it out, though physical discomfort hurt him like
pain.</p>

<p>He listened to the rising of the wind. The worst
storm, old-timers had told him, in fifteen years.</p>

<p>“What was that?” He bounced up from his bed.
Hardin’s cannonading shook his frail tent. He sat down
again. He remembered a performance given by Edwin
Booth in Boston. <i>Lear</i>, it was. He had insisted that
the storm scene was grotesquely exaggerated. He could
not hear the actors’ voices over the storm! Now, he
revised his criticism. The man who had staged that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
play had been in the desert; that desert. It was a fearful
night.</p>

<p>He decided that it was not safe to undress, so he
threw himself across his painted bed. Every few minutes
the deep detonations of Hardin’s charges up at
Fassett’s ranch jarred the platform.</p>

<p>Down at the levee, the night-shifts were piling brush,
dragging it to threatened points where the lapping waves
broke over the levee; sacking sand, piling it in heaps.
On the other side of the gorge, Rickard was blowing
out the west channel to let the increasing flood waters
through. Up the gorge, but below Fassett’s ranch now,
following the retreating platoons of the river, Hardin
was toiling, directing his men. He had refused to listen
to Blinn. Sleep, with the river cutting back like that,
hazarding the valley? Rest? He couldn’t rest with
that noise in his ears. Why, man, this spells ruin!</p>

<p>The wind rose to a gale. Ogilvie’s tent bellied and
swelled. The waves were blowing over the levee. At
midnight, the alarm was sounded. The sleeping shifts
scrambled out of their beds, full dressed, and rode or
ran down to the river. The bells of the two churches
kept ringing. Pale women and children followed the
men down to the embankment. There was work for
every one that night. Men were hustling like mad to
raise the levee an inch above the rising fury of the river.
The women rushed back to their homes, bringing baskets,
old tins, coal-oil cans, anything to scoop or carry
earth. They dragged down worn-out clothes, bags of
scraps, fire-wood; they were fighting now for their future.</p>

<p>Men stood a few feet apart measuring each white-foamed
wave to be ready when it should strike the bank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Wired with hog-fencing on the river side, the long timbers
chained in place to take the blows of the waves,
the levee threatened to melt before each rush of the
river. Shovels stood at attention to throw earth on each
new break; to raise the levee an inch above the lapping
waters. Earth could not now be wasted. The women
were cautioned to conserve their ammunition. Teams
from the ranches brought in hay; wagon-loads of brush
for the dikes.</p>

<p>Down the stream rushed masses of débris; logs, sections
of fence, railroad ties. Every eye on the bank
followed their course. Where would that floating wreckage
lodge? Long poles jumped to shove off into the
stream the drift which must not be allowed to lodge,
to impede that stream for an instant. Swift eyes, swift
hands, needed that night! And all night long into the
gray of the morning, over the roar of the rushing water,
and the whistling of the demons of the wind, boomed
the dynamite at Fassett’s. In the White Refuge, Ogilvie
miserably slept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>OPPOSITION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE second night of the flood, the women of the
towns dragged brush and filled sacks for the men
to carry. It was past midnight when Innes Hardin left
the levee. While her feet and fingers had toiled, her
mind had been fretting over Tom. Two nights, and
no rest! It was told by men who came down the river
how Hardin was heroically laboring. She yearned to
go to him; perhaps he would stop for a few hours to
her entreaty. But an uncertain trail across country,
with the dust-laden wind in her face? She decided to
wait for the dawn. A snatched sleep first, but who
would call her? She would sleep for hours, so weary
every muscle. Her mind fixed on Sam as the only man
in town who had time to saddle a horse for a woman.</p>

<p>She went in search of him. She found that the long
adobe office building had already taken on the look of
defeat, of ruin. The casements had been torn from the
partitions; the doors and windows were out. The furniture
had been hauled up to the White Refuge for
safety. She went hunting through the ghoulish gloom
for the darky, turning her lantern in every dark corner.
She knew that she would find him sleeping.</p>

<p>Then she heard steps on the veranda. She ran
toward them, expecting to see Sam. She swung her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
lantern full on two figures mounting the shallow steps.
Rickard was with her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me!” she blurted blunderingly. Of
course Gerty would take a wrong intention from the
stupid words!</p>

<p>The blue eyes met those of Innes with defiance. It
was as though she had spoken: “Well, think what you
will of it, you Hardins! I don’t care what you think
of me!”</p>

<p>What indeed did she think of it? Why should she
feel like the culprit before these two, her words deserting
her? It was Gerty’s look that made her feel guilty,
as though she had been spying. To meet them together,
here at midnight, why should not <i>they</i> feel ashamed?
She had done nothing wrong. And Tom down yonder
fighting—and they make his absence a cover for their
rendezvous—</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Sam!” The effort behind the words
turned them into an oratorical challenge.</p>

<p>“So are we. I want to send him home with Mrs.
Hardin. She’s worn out.”</p>

<p>“She can go home with me. I am going directly.
As soon as I give a message to Sam.” She instantly
regretted her words, abruptly halting. It came to her
that Rickard would insist upon delivering her message.
Of course, he would oppose her going. Some petty
reason or other. She knew from the men that he was
oppositional, that he liked to show his power. Not
safe, he would say, or the horse was needed, or Sam too
busy to wait on her!</p>

<p>“You can not go home alone, you two. The town
is full of strange Indians. Give me your lantern, Miss
Hardin; I’ll rout out that darky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Rebelliously she gave him the lantern. The light
turned full on her averted angry eyes.</p>

<p>A haughty Thusnelda followed him.</p>

<p>Sam was discovered asleep in the only room where
the windows had not yet been attacked. His head rested
on a bundle of sacked trees which the ladies of the
Improvement Club had planned to plant the next day.
Deep snores betrayed his refuge.</p>

<p>“Here, Sam! I want you to take these ladies home.
Chase yourself. They’ve been working while you’ve
slept. I thought you’d have all these windows out by
now.”</p>

<p>Gerty had to supply the courtesy for two. She told
Mr. Rickard in her appealing way that he had been
very kind; that she “would have been frightened to
death to go home alone.”</p>

<p>Innes had to say something! “Good night!” The
words had an insulting ring.</p>

<p>The wind covered a passionate silence, as the two
women, followed by Sam, yawning and stretching, made
their way down the shrieking street. “It was true,”
Innes was thinking. She had at last stumbled on the
rout, but it was not a matter of personal, but moral
untidiness; not a carelessness of pins or plates, of tapes
or dishes. It was far worse; a slackness of ethics. It
meant more unhappiness for Tom.</p>

<p>As she put her foot on the step leading to her tent,
it discovered something, bulky, resistant.</p>

<p>“Sam,” she cried. “Come back!”</p>

<p>Both Sam and Mrs. Hardin came running from different
directions. An Indian, dead-drunk, lay sprawling
across her steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, suppose we had come alone?” moaned Gerty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Well, we didn’t,” retorted her sister with intentional
rudeness. “What can you do with him, Sam?”</p>

<p>It was a half-hour before Sam could get the reeling
Cocopah started toward Mexicali.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to call me at five!” cried Innes after
him.</p>

<p>Her aching muscles told her that she could not have
slept four hours when the darky was back, knocking
at her door.</p>

<p>“All right,” she pulled herself together. “I’ll be out
in a minute.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to hold him, Miss Innes,” came the negro
voice through the screen door. “He’ll get all tangled
up in the rope. The winds got him all skittish.”</p>

<p>She came out, rubbing her eyes; her khaki suit creased
where she had lain in it. She asked him if he had
seen her brother.</p>

<p>Sam, whom sleep had been occupying, answered evasively.
“I’m not looking for him yet-a-way, Miss Innes!
The river’s cuttin’ back, mighty fas’, they say. A third
of a mile in twenty-fo’ hours. If it keeps up that-away,
it’ll be on us right soon. Mr. Hardin he’s not a-comin’
back so long’s he’s got that there river to fight.”</p>

<p>“I’m going after him. He’s got to stop for me.
Don’t tell any one, Sam, where I’ve gone.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to be goin’ alone, Miss Innes,” he
called after her loping horse. “The new boss wouldn’t
like it. He’s mighty careful about womenfolk!”</p>

<p>She sent a mocking grimace over her shoulder. “Pff!”</p>

<p>Sam grinned. “If she ain’t jes’ the spit of her
brother!” His pace lagged. It had been a hard night’s
work!</p>

<p>Innes’ horse loped through the silent streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“I’ll run past the levee; perhaps Tom has come back.”
It occurred to her that there might be a message at the
hotel. She pulled on her left rein, and swept past the
deserted adobe.</p>

<p>The gorge of the New River was but a rod or so
now from the west side. Sam was right. If the scouring
out of the channel could not be kept to the farther
bank, the towns must go. The levee wouldn’t help them
then.</p>

<p>She knew the danger; she had heard the engineers
talk with Tom. The gradient from Yuma to the Basin
was four feet to the mile, in land which corroded like
sugar. The very thing which had helped them in their
initial labor of canal building would militate against the
safety of the valley now, with the marauding Dragon
at large.</p>

<p>As she reined in her horse, Rickard stepped out on
the sidewalk. He, too, was heavy-eyed from a snatched
nap.</p>

<p>“Were you looking for me?”</p>

<p>The scorn in the girl’s face told him that his question
was stupid. For <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>“Has my brother come back?”</p>

<p>He said he did not know. “You can see, I have been
dreaming!” She would not smile back at him, but rode
off toward the levee. Rickard stood watching her.</p>

<p>Down the street, Fred Eggers was opening his store.
She could see two Indians peering in through the open
door.</p>

<p>Was this the river? West of the levee, a sea of
muddy water spread over the land. There was yet a
chance to save the towns, the <i>town</i>, she corrected herself,
as her eye fell on the Mexican village across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
ditch. For Mexicali was doomed. Some of the mud-huts
had already fallen; the water was running close to
the station-house.</p>

<p>She saw Wooster standing near, calculating the distance,
the time, perhaps, before the new station would go.
Over the door, in freshly painted letters, were the words—“Ferro
Carril de Baja California.” To the east, a
few feet only away, was one of the monuments of the
series placed by the engineers of the Gadsen survey.
They marched from Yuma to the sea in the path of
the old Santa Fe trail, marking on the way the grave
of many a gold-seeker.</p>

<p>She hailed Wooster. Ruin was presaged in the lines
of his forehead.</p>

<p>“Pretty bad?” she cried.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Is Tom back?”</p>

<p>“He’s over there, now. Fighting like all possessed.
He’ll work till he drops.” Wooster was proud of that
method.</p>

<p>“We all know Tom!” Her pride sprang up. “But
he’s got to stop for a while. I’m going up after him.”</p>

<p>“Not if my name’s Wooster. I’ll go. He’ll mind
me.” What if he were dropping, himself, with sleep
and fatigue? It was a chance to serve Hardin; to bring
a smile of gratitude to the eyes of this little comrade
of the desert, whom the engineers adored in their several
fashions. Wooster’s worship was louder than the
others; the younger men shyer, but more fervent.
Wooster found her calm boyish eyes beautiful, but not
disturbing. But she was a Hardin; and a pretty one.
Wooster would serve a Hardin, or a pretty woman,
were his last hour come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Can you?” she cried; meaning—“Would you be so
good?”</p>

<p>“Can I? He’ll mind me,” bragged Wooster. His
small bright eyes snapped over some recollections. “I’ve
made him rest before when he didn’t want to. I can do
it again.”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly good of you, but I mean, can you get
away?”</p>

<p>“I’m through here.” He omitted to say that he was
to report at six in the evening. “I’ll send him back
to you, Miss Hardin.”</p>

<p>“You’re terribly good,” she repeated.</p>

<p>She watched the flowing river, swollen with wreckage.
She saw, with comprehension, a section of a fence;
somebody’s crop gone. There was a railway tie, another!
The river was eating up Estrada’s new road-bed? A
cry broke from her as a mesquit on the coffee-colored
tide caught on a buried snag. The current swirled
dangerously around it. Instantly, the water rose toward
the top of the levee. Men came running to pry
away the tree. A minute later, it was dancing down
the stream. They raised the bank against the pressing
lapping waves. There, the tree had stuck again. They
ran down the levee with their long poles. Each time
that happened, unless the obstruction were swiftly dislodged,
she knew it meant an artificial fall somewhere,
a quick scouring out of the channel. The men were
working like silent parts of a big machine; the confusion
of the first night was gone. From their faces one
would not guess that their fortunes, their homes, hung
on the subduing of that indomitable force which had
not yet known defeat, which had turned back explorer
and conquistador. Ah, there was the lurking fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
it! Victory still lay to its credit; the other column was
blank.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parrish,” she called.</p>

<p>A man on the bank paused, shovel in hand.</p>

<p>She spurred her horse abreast of him.</p>

<p>“How is your wife?”</p>

<p>“Pretty bad. I had to leave her at midnight. I
couldn’t get no one to stay with her. The women have
to mind the ranches these days. She had a spell of
her neuralgia. She couldn’t have come with me any
way.” He was torn between his duty and his fears.</p>

<p>“When do you go back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We are all needed here. Mexicali’s
going. I’ll be lucky if I get sent back to-night.”</p>

<p>“It’s going down the Wistaria?”</p>

<p>“Enough to scare her. The ranch’s as good as gone
already. What good’s the land if we can’t get water
up to it?”</p>

<p>“I know,” murmured Innes.</p>

<p>“I’m not blaming any one, Miss Hardin. Unless it’s
myself. I ought never to have brought her here. Not
until the river’s settled. The wind’s the worst to her;
she’s that scared of the wind.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and bring her home with me. You’ll feel
better to have her near town,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s first-class.” His relief was pathetic. His
dull fidelity, his love for that nervous wreck of a woman,
rose that instant to the dignity of a romance. She
thought of the purple flannel waist, the untidy home,
the smell of burning rice, of scorched codfish, the loving
struggle of the woman who dared life in the desert
beside her mate, lacking the strength to make it tolerable
to either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“I’ll bring her home with me,” she repeated.</p>

<p>She did not wait for his gratitude. Her horse was
turned back to town. She saw Wooster coming toward
her. His snapping black eyes shot out sparks of anger.</p>

<p>“He won’t let me go.”</p>

<p>“Who won’t let you?” But she knew.</p>

<p>“Casey. Says he’ll send some one else. I said as
nobody else’d make Hardin stop. He said as that was
up to Hardin.”</p>

<p>Of course, he wouldn’t let Wooster go! Her offer
to Parrish suddenly shackled her.</p>

<p>“Orders me to bed,” spat Wooster. “Wonder why
he didn’t order gruel, too. It’s spite, antagonism to
Hardin, that’s what it is!” She believed that, too. Tom
was right. Rickard did take advantage of his authority.</p>

<p>She did not see Rickard until he stood by her side.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry not to spare Wooster, Miss Hardin. But
there’s stiff work ahead. He’s got to be ready for a
call. If Hardin insists on spoiling one good soldier,
that’s his affair. I can’t let him spoil two.”</p>

<p>Wooster shrugged, and left them. “Spoiling good
soldiers!”</p>

<p>“I’ve taken Bodefeldt off duty. I told him to relieve
Hardin.”</p>

<p>Bodefeldt who blushed when any one looked at him!
He would be about as persuasive to Tom as a veil to
a desert wind! She turned away, but not before Rickard
saw again that transforming anger. Her eyes shone
like topazes in sunlight. She would not trust herself
to speak. Wooster was waiting for her. Rickard could
hear the man repeat. “I’m sorry, Miss Hardin. It’s
an outrage. That’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Queer, they couldn’t see that it was Hardin’s fault;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Hardin, who was up the river fighting like a melodramatic
hero; fighting without caution or reserve, demoralizing
discipline; he couldn’t help admiring the
bulldog energy, himself. That was what all these men
adored. He’d clenched the girl’s antagonism, now, for
sure! How her eyes had flashed at him!</p>

<p>Hello! There was a tree floating down toward the
station-house....</p>

<p>“Bring your poles!” he yelled.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">INNES was loping toward the Wistaria, the wind in
her face till she turned west by the canal. It occurred
to her then, that she did not know how she
was going to cross the river; it cut the canal; that was
the cut which was threatening that district. She had
not thought to ask Parrish whether they boated it across,
or if there was a cable across the stream. She would
not turn back, she would meet some one.</p>

<p>She was a part of a fleeing universe; the wind, the
dust-clouds, the victorious racing river, her good horse
loping free—herself on the edge of the mad wild world!
Because she was young, and life was dramatic to her,
the wind took possession of her spirit, which spread
its wings toward the broad sweep of moving plains,
to the sharp jagged line of dust-obscured mountain.
The conflict of Titans called to her; it was a great
music drama; the wind had its own wild rôle; the river,
the fervid lover, and the desert a lean, brown Indian
maid resisting his ardor. The Valkyrie’s call burst
from her. She was riding to it; she threw the five
splendid notes against the shriek of the elemental battle.</p>

<p>Desperate pygmies, all of them; ants, protecting their
little ant-hill against Titans—Ogilvie in his tent, Eggers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
a prisoner to fear—the women planting their little trees,
the men defending their toy levee against the Dragon
and the strength of its ravished mate; absurd, impotent
the weak human effort! Had she caught Estrada’s feeling?
She had taxed him often with skepticism. True,
he has not answered her, except with those truthful,
melancholy eyes of his!</p>

<p>Queer, that reserve—with her, when she knew what
she knew! What had given her the conviction that
he did not want to tell her that he cared? Why did
he guard his lips, when his eyes, his mind cried out to
her, not only when she was with him, but in the night,
when all the world slept, and he miles from her, his
need wakening her, chaining, was it imagination, or
was this—Love? His affection deeper than all the others,
and he the only one she did not have to remind,—continually
remind!—of their soldiery.</p>

<p><i>Good soldiers!</i></p>

<p>Had she been too quick to take offense that morning?
Could she expect that he—Mr. Rickard—could
not see the failings she herself feared? Tom was splendid,
heroic, yes, but a good soldier? The other had taken
a soldier’s drilling—Eduardo had told her of Wyoming,
and the Mexican barrancas—Tom was unjust in that—unjust
to Marshall. Rickard was not a bookman. Even
if she did not like him—!</p>

<p>She saw Busby, who was driving away from the Wistaria.</p>

<p>She hailed him. “Tell me,” she called. “How do you
get over?”</p>

<p>“They’ve strung a cable. Looking for Mrs. Parrish?”</p>

<p>His wagon was heaped high with household loot, tins
and frying-pans, brooms and a battered graphophone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Something had happened! The wind drowned her words,
but her hands challenged his cargo.</p>

<p>“Her tent blew down! She’s over at my house.” He
drove abreast of her.</p>

<p>“<i>Her</i> tent!”</p>

<p>That it should be her tent to go! She thought to ask
if Mrs. Parrish had been hurt, but Busby did not hear
the question.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been over to see what I could save. The
Indians would be carrying these away. A woman sets
a store by her pots and pans and dishes. The dishes,
well, they’re gone, of course; splinters!”</p>

<p>“Then there is no use going there—I’ll go over to your
place.”</p>

<p>“Go back by Jones’ ranch,” shouted Busby over his
shoulder. “It’s quicker than the road ahorseback.”</p>

<p>Her pagan joy was quenched. Her pace was now a
sober one. He had not said if Mrs. Parrish was hurt.</p>

<p>The tidy farm of the Busbys looked wind-blown and
dispirited. The young orange trees had torn from their
stakes; they curved away from the castigating wind.
The alfalfa fields had withstood the blight, and the young
willows which fringed the ditch, doubling to the breeze,
sprang back like elastic when it passed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby came out on the porch to meet her. Innes
was tying her horse. “How is she?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Asleep, I think. Tie him fast. This wind makes
the beasts restless. Come right in.”</p>

<p>Not even a desert storm would be allowed to meddle
with that interior. The room Innes entered was freshly
dusted. It was glaringly ugly; neat and comfortable.
Tiers of labeled boxes rose from a pine shelf; a motley
collection of calico bags hung from hooks beneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“How did you get her here? How did you know?”
demanded Innes.</p>

<p>“She told us herself. She must have <i>crawled here</i>.”</p>

<p>“Crawled! She <i>was</i> hurt, then!”</p>

<p>“Who told you? Where’d you hear it?”</p>

<p>“I met Mr. Busby. <i>Was</i> she hurt?”</p>

<p>“Did he find anything? Was he goin’ there or was he
comin’ away? I guess there wasn’t much left with that
roof fallin’ in.”</p>

<p>There was a sound from the room beyond. Mrs.
Busby disappeared. A minute later, she beckoned from
the darkened chamber. Innes crept in fearfully.</p>

<p>It was a terrible face that looked up from the pillow.
A red gash had mutilated the cheek; the nose was
scraped. Worse to Innes was the motion of the features—the
eyelids, the lips, the chin were twitching the face
into a horror. From the staring eyeballs, a crazed appeal
shot up.</p>

<p>“She’s anxious as you shan’t tell her husband. He’s
got his work to do. She sent word by Busby as she’s
all right.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t tell him,” said Innes pitifully.</p>

<p>A hand that looked like a claw picked at the coarse
white spread. The jerking mouth was trying to tell her
something. Mrs. Busby leaned over the bed.</p>

<p>“She’s worrying about Mrs. Dowker. Now, if that
doesn’t beat all! I’m tellin’ her you’ll go and see if
they’re all right. The boy is sick.” An open wink disavowed
the obligation.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll go,” cried Innes, not heeding the signal.
“Is—is her arm broken?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Busby was silent. The woman on the bed had
to answer that question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“It—fell on me. I—always—knew it would. I got
under the bed. A beam struck my arm.”</p>

<p>Innes pointed to the skilful bandage.</p>

<p>“Who set it?”</p>

<p>“I did.” Mrs. Busby showed embarrassment. Frontier
skill and her new faith were not yet in harmony.
“It wasn’t no time to argue.”</p>

<p>The morning was gone when Innes turned from the
Dowker tent. She was despondently comparing life to
a vise, “that is, woman’s life!” How much easier to be
a man, to fight the big fight, than the eternal wrestle with
dirt and disorder! No, a woman’s life is a river, she
changed her comparison whimsically, a shallow stream
ending in a—sink! Small wonder that the sad asylums
were full of women, women from the farms. Tom’s
work would help that, the Hardins, the Estradas; she
had heard Captain Brandon tell of the deliverance promised
by the gospel of irrigation! The women on the
farms of to-morrow would not have isolation or pioneer
toil for their portion. But these were the real pioneers,
these women! Theirs was the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Gerty called to her from the neighboring tent as she
was entering her own.</p>

<p>“Do you mind cleaning up for me to-day? Tom may
come home. I left the dishes last night, and I’ve got one
of my terrible headaches.”</p>

<p>Soon she had the hot water waiting for the tray of
scraped dishes. She had planned to go back to the river.
“A shallow stream ending in a sink!” she chirped to a
rueful reflection from one of Gerty’s new tins. “Oh,
smile, Innes Hardin! You look just like a Gingg!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE PASSING OF THE WATERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BABCOCK came rushing down from Los Angeles
that morning to see what in thunder it was all about.
He asked every one he met why some one didn’t get busy
and stop the cutting back of that river? There was no one
at the offices of the company to report to him! Why,
the building was deserted! Ogilvie’s letters had prophesied
ruin. It all looked wrong to him. Going on to
the levee, he met MacLean, Jr., who was coming away.
The boy told him vaguely that he would find Rickard
around there, somewhere.</p>

<p>“I’ll hunt him up for you.”</p>

<p>“Why, they are letting it get ahead of them!” Babcock’s
manner suggested that he was aggrieved that such
carelessness to his revered company should go unpunished.
Something, he told MacLean, might have been
done before the situation got as bad as this!</p>

<p>His excited stride carried him across the dividing
ditch, which now was carrying no water, into Mexicali.
MacLean had to lengthen his step to keep pace with him.
The havoc done to the Mexican village excited Babcock
still more.</p>

<p>Estrada, just in from his submerged tracks, was lounging
against an adobe wall. His pensive gaze was turned
up-stream. The posture of exhaustion suggested laziness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
to Babcock, who was on the hunt for responsibility. He
was more than ever convinced that the right thing was
not being done.</p>

<p>“Estrada!”</p>

<p>Estrada took his eyes from the river. Babcock looked
like a snapping terrier taking the ditch at a bound. MacLean,
Jr., a lithe greyhound, followed.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you doing to stop this?” A nervous
hand indicated the Mexican station gleaming in its
fresh coat of paint; to the muddy water undermining its
foundation.</p>

<p>Estrada drew a cigarette out of his pocket; lighted it
before answering.</p>

<p>“Not a God damn thing. What do you suggest?”</p>

<p>A big wave struck the bank. The car on the siding
trembled.</p>

<p>“Another wave like that and that car’ll go over,” cried
Babcock, jumping, mad. “Why don’t you do something?
Why don’t you hustle—all of you?” He would report
this incompetency.</p>

<p>Down the stream came a mass of débris, broken timbers,
ravaged brush, a wrenched fence post, a chicken
coop. A red hen, clinging to its swaying ship, took the
rapids.</p>

<p>“Hustle—what?” murmured Estrada.</p>

<p>Babcock glared at him, then at the river. His eye
caught the approaching wreckage. Men came running
with their poles. The caving bank was too far gone.
The instant the drifting mass struck it, there was a shudder
of falling earth, the car toppled toward the flood
waters, the waves breaking into clouds of spray.</p>

<p>Human responsibility fell to a cipher. The river’s
might was magnificent. Even Babcock, come to carp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
caught the excitement. “Come, MacLean,” he cried.
“Watch this! The station’s going!” He joined Estrada
by the adobe wall.</p>

<p>“Have a cigarette?” murmured Eduardo.</p>

<p>His eyes glued to the lurching station-house, Babcock
took a brown-paper-rolled cigarette from the proffered
box.</p>

<p>“Look,” he cried. “There, she’ll go. See that—”</p>

<p>There was a splash of splintering timber; a Niagara of
spray as the building fell into the flood. A minute later,
a wreckage of painted boards was floating down-stream.</p>

<p>At table Babcock resumed his campaign. “The trouble
with you all, you have cold feet. You’re all scared off
too soon.”</p>

<p>Wooster, up from his nap, looked across the table.
“Cold feet? So you’d have if you had been up for nights,
wetting your feet on the levee, as some of us have, as
Hardin has. Mine are cold all right.” He lifted an
amazed foot. “Cold! Look here, boys, they’re wet!”
The men looked to find the water creeping in—Babcock
climbed on his chair.</p>

<p>“This means the station,” cried Wooster. Every man
jumped. If the waters had got to <i>them</i>, it wouldn’t be
long before they were reaching the O. P. depot! The
tracks would go— They were piling out of the door
when the telephone caught them. It was a message from
Rickard. A car was to be rigged up, papers, tickets
and express matter taken from the station. The river
was cutting close to the track. The car would be the
terminal, a half-mile from town.</p>

<p>The situation looked black. Coulter, Eggers, began to
pack their stock. The levee, it was said, would not hold— Half
of Mexicali was gone. Calexico would go next.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Rickard’s Indians were kept stolidly piling brush and
stuffed sacks on the levee. This, the word ran, would
be the fierce night—no one expected to sleep.</p>

<p>They were preparing for the big battle, the final struggle,
when the grade recession passed the town. Spectacular
as was its coming, there was an anticlimax in its
retreat. The water reached the platform of the depot,
and halted. The town held its breath. There was some
sleep that night.</p>

<p>The next day, the nerves of the valley relaxed. The
river was not cutting back. The men at the levee dropped
their shovels, and went back to the discussion of their
lawsuits. Their crops were ruined; too much water, or
too little. Whatever way they had been hurt, the company
would have to pay for it!</p>

<p>A small shift guarded the river. Rickard, in his room
at the Desert Hotel, and Hardin up the river, slept a day
and a night without waking. The chair-tilters picked up
their argument where they had left it: was the railroad
reaping a harvest of damage suits when they should be
thanked instead? Faraday, the newspapers reported, was
trying to shift his responsibility; he had appealed to the
president. Their correspondence was published. The
government was in no hurry to take the burden. A telegraphic
sermon, preaching duty, distributing blame, was
sent from Washington. Perhaps not Faraday himself
was more disturbed than the debaters of the Desert Hotel.</p>

<p>“The railroad’s no infant in arms! It wasn’t asleep
when it took over the affairs of the D. R.” Here spoke
the majority. “A benefaction! It was self-interest!
When the river is harnessed, who’ll profit the most from
the valley prosperity? It can afford to pay the obligations;
that is, it could. It will find a way,” the ravens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
croaked, “of shaking the Desert Reclamation Company’s
debts; of evading the damage suits. Look how Hardin
was treated!”</p>

<p>The feeling ran higher. For many of the ranchers
were ruined; there was no money to put in the next
year’s crop unless the promises of the irrigation company
were kept. A few landowners, and others who had not
completed their contracts, distrusting the good faith of
the company, or its ability to pay, had “quit” in disgust,
to begin again somewhere else. Parrish, and Dowker,
and others of the “Sixth” scoured district had secured
the promise of employment at the Heading. Work, it
was expected, would be begun at once now that the
danger to Calexico had passed.</p>

<p>MacLean and Estrada met outside the water-tower.</p>

<p>“Have you been up?” Estrada nodded toward the
platform that carried the great tank. “Come up with
me. They say it’s worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“Can’t.” MacLean was plunging toward the office,
his boyish face indicating the enjoyment of his importance.
“Too much work. The office work is all piled up.
The office, itself, looks like the day after a fire! They’re
putting back the windows. Casey and I have a desk
between us. We’re requisitioning quarries, and scraping
the country with a fine comb for labor. Jinks, but it’s
great!”</p>

<p>Estrada climbed alone the steep inner staircase of the
water-tower. He was thinking of the young American,
vaguely envying him. There was something the other
had that he wanted. He himself could work as hard
for the river; but shout for it? That was where he
stopped. He lacked, he could admit it to himself, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
quality of enthusiasm. A son of Guillermo Estrada,—lacking
enthusiasm!</p>

<p>From the platform he looked down over the submerged
country. To the west, the muddy waters spread out over
the land. Eleven miles, he had heard it said, were covered.
His sympathy was seeing, not a drowned country,
but submerged hopes. The pain of it, the histories beneath
it, tugged at his heart. Distantly, he could see the
ravaged district of the Wistaria, spoiled for this year
surely, perhaps forever made useless. Not until the
waters withdrew, would they know the extent of the
ruin. From the north, between Fassett’s and the towns,
steadily advancing, Hardin’s gang was still serenading;
the boom of his drums came clearly through the still air.</p>

<p>Below him lay the valley of his father’s vision. The
story of that desert journey had been told him so vividly,
so variously that he had made himself one of the party.
Coronel was there, the general, and Bliss—dead soon
after; Hardin, Silent. Out of a clear morning, following
the storm, flashed the mirage which came to Estrada as
prophecy,—the city vision which summoned him to fulfil
the Fremont-Powell dream. “That barren land, and a
rich river flowing over yonder!” His father’s vibrant
voice returned to his memory; how often had he heard
him cry: “The young men pressing in from the congested
cities to get their living out of that unworked
soil; a clean living, Eduardo!” And Silent had told him
how the general had looked like a prophet of ancient
Israel that mystic morning when he turned from the
mirage of spires and turrets and tender colored walls,
exclaiming, “God! If I were young like you, Silent, I’d
build that city! that city that we see!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>And now, the cities, embryonic, were there, but would
they stay? Built like the parabled city upon sand—sand
without water!—would they not crumble and melt away,
even as the mirage had faded? He forced himself to
translate his conviction into material reasons. The desert
was convincing. With its past defying history, its future
appealed to the imagination as unchanging, eternal. Even
now, those houses down yonder, in their ugly concreteness,
were less real than the idea of the desert surrounding
the little patch of civilization. Brandon’s words, from
his monograph on desert soils, recurred to him. “The
desert is a condition, not a fact.” To him, the desert was
a fact.</p>

<p>Eduardo was conscious that he was thinking with the
surface of his mind. He was withholding the belief in
the negative sense which told him that he would never see
that river subdued to service. A skeptic, Innes had called
him! He made himself argue it out as a matter of temperament;
his father’s had been optimistic, fervid; his
was detached and analytical. The general had been militant;
he was a dreamer. To him, this was a drama of
form and color, a picture, a panorama—Parrish, Hardin,
each in his place.</p>

<p>Had he but the dynamic energy which had swept his
father through his vivid, versatile life! Once, under the
spell of the general’s magnetism, he had been able to
force that zeal, that enthusiasm, to recharge his own
weakened batteries; but later, while flinging, perhaps,
a track across a waste of sands, and a squaw’s bright
skirt against a cloud-free sky, or a buck’s striped breast
rising from a clump of creosote, would make his work
a grind again. He had misplaced himself. What else,
then, should he be doing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Often, and now, looking down on that chocolate-colored
land, it would come to him that his was the yearning,
the wistfulness of the painter. Those purple mountains
flushing to rosy points against a clear blue sky, that rushing
water, what did it rouse in him? A sense of militancy,
as with Rickard and Hardin, MacLean, all of
them? It pricked instead, an irritation, a feeling of incompleteness.
He wanted something; could a man be
homesick for what he never had?</p>

<p>It was not the valley scheme alone, which made of his
mind a battle-ground. Did he not meet life so, with a
ready hand and a lagging spirit? That girl down there!
Had he the blood of his father in his veins, would he not
take her of the steady boyish gaze, match her sweetness
with just loving? What was it that told him it would
never be? Why did he keep guard over lips and eyes?
She looked at others with the same level, straightforward
frankness she gave to him; the game was, perhaps, yet to
him who ran! If it were going to be, there would be a
spring of joy within his heart. It was not going to be.
He had asked before, and it had answered.</p>

<p>Whose was the answer, that came to him, sometimes
at call, often unbidden? Intangible as moonlight, real
as the voice of a friend? Can you see a voice? No substance
to a voice? Let it come to again, let it tell him
of that river; should he see it, the vision of his father,
of the others, he, Eduardo?</p>

<p>Standing in the wash of clear sunlight, his arms outstretched
to the land his father’s vision had peopled, he
sent out his call that he should see that dream fulfilled,
the river conquered. Give him back his belief! Give
him back the courage that would make him one with the
folk down there!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Out of that land of silence came, as a wave of darkness,
a mist shutting out the sun, separating him from his
fellows, the answer. No need to question that! Had it
ever erred? Slowly, as a dream-walker, he went down
the tower steps, and mingled with men again.</p>

<p>A week later, he was standing on the same platform.
The sky was still fleckless; the painted flat mountains
made sharp points into the vivid blue of the sky. The
heat was holding off. The desert was spelling out her
siren lure. But her lover had retreated to his gipsy bed;
her brown lean breast was no longer pillowing him.</p>

<p>In the gorge west of the town, the water was now confined.
The recession of the waters disclosed the ravaged
Palo Verde, its shattered vineyard set in a square of
eucalyptus trees, young giants of three years’ planting.
Northward, Estrada caught the gleam of sunshine on
broad barley-fields; he saw the glistening foliage of the
orange orchards, Busby’s and the others. Between him
and the eastern range spread miles of sweet-smelling alfalfa.
Young willow growth checker-boarded the country,
marking the canal system. All that in a few years;
the miracle of irrigation. He had seen virgin desert, as
this had been when his father had crossed with Bliss and
Hardin; six years before, when he had first seen it, it was
still desert, such as he was flinging a track across, of
creosote-bush, and tough mesquit roots, and here and
there, the arrow-weed. Who could tell of the next six
years? Perhaps, the rest would be vanquished, and the
river yet a meek water-carrier? But he knew!</p>

<p>On the veranda of the office, an hour later, he met
Rickard, carrying his Gladstone.</p>

<p>“I’m off!” The American halted, poised, as if for the
next step of a dance, so it appeared to Estrada. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
eyes were glowing, as though a boy springing toward
vacation.</p>

<p>“The Heading? Have you had word yet?”</p>

<p>“They’re still passing the buck to each other! But
I’ll be there when it comes. You’ll see that Dragon
scotched yet, Estrada!”</p>

<p>He carried the look of victory. But so also, had Tom
Hardin! So once had the general! And the river still
running to the sea!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>MORE ORATORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOUR men sat at a small table in a corner of the
crowded hotel dining-room, in El Centro. Their
names made their corner the psychological center of the
room. Marshall was always a target of speculation.
MacLean, straight and soldierly in his mustard-colored
clothes, was, as usual, the man of distinction. Black
started the whisper going that the dark stranger was
General de la Vega, the Mexican commissioner.</p>

<p>What was he doing in that group? Babcock completed
a combination which encouraged speculations and head-shakings.
The room was jammed with valley men. The
meeting of the ranchers and the several water companies
had been called for that afternoon, the summons signed
by Faraday himself. Nothing else had been talked of for
a fortnight.</p>

<p>It was known throughout the valley that the work at
the intake was not yet begun; that Rickard was waiting
there for orders; that Faraday and the president of the
United States were involved in correspondence as to the
responsibility for the future control of the river. Faraday’s
eagerness to shift his burden was looked upon as
suspicious. It was in the air that the officers of the Overland
Pacific would demand a recall of the damage suits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
before they would complete the protective works at the
Heading. The men of long vision, members of the water
companies, and Brandon, through the valley <i>Star</i>, were
pointing out that the valley’s salvation depended on the
immediate control of the river; that the railroad, only,
had power to effect it. These conservatives were counseling
caution. Only that morning, the <i>Star</i> had issued
an extra, a special edition pleading for cooperation.
“If the river breaks out again,” warned Brandon’s editorial,
“without immediate force to restrain it, reclamation
for that valley is a dream that is done. And the
only force equal to that emergency is the railroad. Why
deliberately antagonize the railroad? The Desert Reclamation
Company, it is well known, is bankrupt. For the
instant, the railroad has assumed the responsibilities of
the smaller organization. Apply the same situation to individuals.
Suppose a private citizen is in straits, and
another comes forward to help him. Must every creditor
assume that the Samaritan should pay the crushed citizen’s
bills? In the present issue, self-interest should urge
consideration. Better a small loss to-day that to-morrow
may amply refund, than total ruin in the future.”</p>

<p>“Subsidized by the O. P.!” With the whisper ran a
wink. The advice of all the conservatives was believed
to be business policy. Black and others were inflaming
public spirit. During the week that followed Faraday’s
call, there had been meetings of the various water companies;
incendiary excitement had demoralized the discussions.
“The pledges of the Desert Reclamation should
be kept.”</p>

<p>Hardin, from his morose unshared table, could see
the anxious curiosity setting toward the railroad group.
Over glasses, heads were close together. Near him, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
talk ran high. Scraps of inflammable speeches blew his
way from Barton’s party.</p>

<p>Hardin’s mouth wore a set sneer. “Water company
talk!” Black was haranguing his comrades. “Stand
out against them. Don’t let them bluff you. Marshall
will try to bluff you. Stand together!” Barton’s resonant
organ broke through the clatter. “Marshall is not
going to bluff us.” Grace and Black began to talk at
once. Hardin’s lip grew rougher. Where had they all
been if it had not been for him? Why, he’d pulled them
from their little farms back East, where they were toiling—where
they’d be toiling yet. They’d had the vision of
sudden wealth—they hadn’t the grit to work for it, to
wait for it! How many years had he been struggling?
He was a young man when he’d gone into this thing, and
he was old now.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on Hollister from the Palo Verde, with
Youngberg and his wife, who in pale gray cloth looked
as though she were on her way to a reception. He scowled
at the leveling of gold lorgnettes in Morton’s group—the
eastern swells there for a possible sensation! And Senator
Graves had thought it important enough to come
down from Los Angeles? The tall duffer with him, his
head gleaming like a billiard ball, was probably the New
York lawyer who was dickering for the A B C ranch.
He had read of it in the Los Angeles papers; a big syndicate
thought this the time to get in cheap, when confidence
was at a low ebb. “It’s high-water mark with Graves, or
nothing,” scowled Hardin. “He’s no spring chicken.
They’ll all make money out of this valley, but me. I
haven’t tried to make money; I’ve made the valley! And
is there a more hated man in this room? Sickening!”</p>

<p>Coffee and cigars had been reached of the midday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
dinner. Babcock was nervously consulting his watch.
“Shouldn’t we arrange the meeting?” he asked for the
third time. The social and casual air of the meeting had
teased him. What had the political situation in Mexico
to do with the important session confronting them? His
fussy soul had no polite salons; office rooms every one
of them. MacLean looked to Tod Marshall to answer.</p>

<p>“I think it will arrange itself,” his voice was silken.
“It is to be a discussion, a conference. You can’t slate
that.”</p>

<p>“We could program,” began Babcock, looking at his
watch again.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ll have to.” Marshall smiled across
the table. “You’ll find this meeting will run itself. There
is not a man here who is not burning to speak. Look at
them now! Drop a paper in that crowd, and see the
blaze you’d get! You can open the meeting, Mr. Babcock,
and I would suggest that you call on Mr. de la Vega
first.”</p>

<p>“And next?” Babcock’s nervous pencil hovered over
his note-book.</p>

<p>“The rest will resolve itself.” Marshall’s eyes were
twinkling. “We’ll find our cue. I’ll kick you under the
table when I want to talk. You can’t program against
passions, Babcock.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to be starting.” Fussily Babcock marshaled
them from their leisurely cigars. “It is getting
late.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the dining-room followed the party as they
filed past the buzzing tables. Faraday was not in town;
Marshall represented that power. As he walked out,
bowing right and left, his right hand occasionally extended
in his well-known oratorical, courteous gesture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
His black tie was stringing down his shirt-front; his
black clothes were the worse for his lunch. But no one,
save the eastern girls, saw spots or tie. The future of
that valley lay in that man’s hand, no matter how Black
or Grace might harangue. In five minutes, the dining-room
was emptied.</p>

<p>The main street was lined with groups of ranchers,
who had driven in to the advertised meeting. On some
of the wagons, men were finishing their basket lunches.
The sun was mild; the sky clear.</p>

<p>Hardin overheard bits of eager argument as he
threaded the crowded street, his head down, avoiding
recognition.</p>

<p>“The Service’ll try to get in.” “The O. P.’s got a good
thing.” “I tell you, the railroad’s in a hole.” “Faraday’s
a fathead.”</p>

<p>As snow gently falling, had gathered the first damage
suits of the ranchers. The last flood had precipitated a
temperamental storm. Men were suing for the possible
values of their farms, impossible values of crops. Not
alone the companies had been blanketed with the accusing
papers, but against Mexico the white drifts had piled
up. Mexico! No one knew better than Hardin how absurd
it was to accuse the sister country of responsibility.
A pretty pickle they were in! Where was it all going to
end?</p>

<p>The town teemed with importance. In the whole valley,
this was the one place which could house the expected
crowd. The spectacular new city, which had sprung full
grown from the head of its Jovian promoter, Petrie,
whose outlying lands must be brought into value, had
justified itself. It had offered its theater. Toward that
white-painted building, fresh as crude wine, the groups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
were turning. To Hardin, borne along with the stream
which overflowed from the narrow walks, came the memory
of a forgotten tale: a palace raised in a single night
was scarcely more spectacular than this town of a year’s
growth. A theater, a steam-laundry, an ice-plant, and
his eyes included two new book-stores, new at least to
him. Where would all this have been if it had not been
for him? And what was he? An outcast in their midst,
no one speaking to him! But they’d need him yet; they’d
be turning to him. It would be all right, somehow! He’d
make Gert proud of him!</p>

<p>Groups of men were standing around the entrance to
the Valley Theater, where the lithographed bill-boards
were still proclaiming five weeks of grand and comic
opera. One week of successful programs, the preceding
spring, and the roistering singers had disbanded to form
a melon company. They had rented a tract, some tents,
and had gone in pursuit of swift money. After the harvesting
of their crops, the heat of the summer and the
clink of the dollars in their pockets had discouraged the
completion of the engagement. Abandoning their intention,
the genial troupe had swept out of the steaming
valley to tell their merry story on the Rialto.</p>

<p>In the lobby, Hardin ran up against Brandon, who was
following a news scent. Through the valley it was being
rumored that subscriptions were to be asked for the completion
of the work. If this were the intention, there
would be a hot meeting, worth sending to the <i>Sun</i>.
The war-horse was treading battle-ground.</p>

<p>“You are going on the platform?” assumed the newspaper
man. “No? Then will you sit with me?”</p>

<p>“If you will sit up-stairs,” scowled Hardin, “I don’t
want to be dragged on to the platform.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>He led the way up the dusty dark steps to the balcony,
and on to the rear where the ceiling sharply slanted.
They established themselves in seats by the wall. The
air had a dry smell of old tobacco and stale perfumes;
of face powders. Brandon had a minute of coughing.</p>

<p>When they had entered, only a few seats were occupied.
That instant, the crowd crushed in. Men and
women jostled one another in the narrow aisles; the
chairs filled up; some of the younger men jumped over
chair-backs, as sheep over rocks. Hardin and Brandon
leaned over to see the inrush. They saw Barton’s shriveled
body and leonine head borne in by his friends. Senator
Graves was entering a proscenium box with his companion.</p>

<p>“That’s Hawkins, who represents the Eastern syndicate
that’s bargaining for the A B C,” informed Brandon.</p>

<p>“I could have got that land for ten cents an acre when
I began this work, if I’d looked out for myself! It would
have been better if I had looked out for myself; what
thanks do I get for only working for the valley?”
grouched Hardin. “What’s Graves holding out for?”</p>

<p>“One thousand an acre, and he’ll get it,” answered
Brandon. “That soil is as rich as gold dust. Hello,
there’s Watts, of Water Company Number Two; and
John Francis, and Green and Ford. They’ve not sent representatives
from the water companies, Hardin! They’ve
come as a body!”</p>

<p>His excitement communicated itself speedily to his
companion.</p>

<p>“Something’s going to drop, sure!”</p>

<p>“And Wilson, with Petrie. I didn’t know <i>he</i> was in
any of the water companies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Is there anything in the valley he’s not in?” All of
them with the idea of making money; all but himself!</p>

<p>Down in the orchestra, Black from the Wistaria was
haranguing a group of gesticulating ranchers. Phrases
climbed to the men on the balcony seats. “Keep their
pledges. Promise makers. Let them look at our crops!”</p>

<p>“Every man thinking of himself, of his own precious
skin!” sneered Hardin.</p>

<p>Hollister and the Youngbergs were seen taking their
seats near the orchestra stand, behind the bickering
merry Blinns. Morton was filling the other proscenium
with his eastern guests.</p>

<p>Brandon had to surrender to an attack of coughing.
He leaned, spent, against the wall. “That audience,” he
gasped, “represents several million dollars—of dissatisfaction.”
The phrase had come to him in his paroxysm.
He would use it in his story for the <i>Sun</i>. If there was
a story.</p>

<p>“If Marshall expects to coerce those men, I lose my
guess. Then he’s no judge of men,” cried Hardin. “Look
at those faces.” The floor was a sea of impassioned
features.</p>

<p>“Something’s going to drop,” echoed Brandon.</p>

<p>From the wings, Babcock’s inquisitive glasses were seen
to sweep the house. Hardin could catch the summons
of an excited forefinger to the group unseen. There was
a minute of delay. Then Babcock’s nervous toddle carried
him on to the stage which had been set for <i>Robin
Hood</i>, the scenery deserted when the singers had rushed
out of the valley. Babcock’s striped, modern trousers
looked absurdly anachronistic against the background of
old England. There was a titter from Morton’s proscenium
box where the lorgnettes were flashing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>De la Vega followed Babcock. There was a hush of
curiosity. The house did not know who he was. Behind
him, soldierly, stiff, stalked MacLean. Marshall’s
entrance released the tongues. There was an interval
of confusion on the stage. Babcock, like a restless terrier,
was snapping at the heels of the party. At last, they
were all fussily seated. De la Vega was given the place
of honor. Marshall, Babcock put on his left, MacLean
on the right.</p>

<p>Babcock raised his staccate gavel. A hush fell on the
house. His words were clipped and sharp.</p>

<p>“You have left your plowing to come here. You are
anxious to hear what we have to say to you. You can
not afford to be indifferent to it. You acknowledge, by
your presence, a dependence, a correlation which you
would like to deny. Irrigation means cooperation, suffering
together, struggling together, succeeding together.
You prefer the old individual way, each man for himself.
I tell you it won’t do. You belong in other countries,
the countries of old-fashioned rain. You want to hear
what we have to say to you, the company who saved the
valley, the company you are suing. But you have also
suits against Mexico. There is a gentleman here who
has a message from Mexico about those suits. I have
the honor, gentlemen, to introduce, Señor de la Vega.”</p>

<p>There was a gentle stir of released hazards. The
Spaniard approached the footlights, his survey sweeping
the house.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t bad,” murmured Brandon, opening his
note-book.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” bowed the Mexican. “Gentlemen, Mr. Chairman.
It is with an appreciation of the honor that I accepted
for to-day the invitation of Mr. Marshall to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
before you, to speak <i>to</i> you; I must tell you first my
thought as I sat there and looked at you, the youth, the
flower of the American people. A few years ago, we
were calling this the great Colorado Desert; now, the
world calls it the hothouse of America. This theater
is built over the bones of gold-seekers, who dared death
in this dreaded desert to find what was buried in those
mountains beyond. The man, I say, who crossed this
desert, took the hazard of death. It was a countryman
of mine who piloted, fifteen years ago, a little band of
men, across the desert. Perhaps he camped on this very
spot. It is not impossible! It is here, perhaps, that he
got his inspiration. He saw a wonderful territory; he
dreamed to quicken it with the useless waters of the
Colorado. You will all agree that it was Guillermo
Estrada who dreamed the dream that has come true; that
it was through him that some of your countrymen secured
their privilege to reclaim this land. Later, when one of
your countrymen found he could not fulfil his promise
to you, the promise to deliver water to your ranches, he
came to my nation and got permission to cut into the
river on our territory. Most gladly did Porfirio Diaz
grant that privilege. For that, to-day, you are suing
him. This, I am told, is your complaint.”</p>

<p>His abrupt pause betrayed a confused murmur of
voices. De la Vega’s polite ear tried to differentiate the
phrases. There was a jumble of sound. De la Vega
looked inquiringly at Babcock, who waved him on.</p>

<p>“It has nothing to do with the history, but I would
like to say in passing that so assured were your people
of our friendly feeling toward you that they did not
wait to receive permission from Mexico to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
cut. Your people were in a hurry. Your crops were in
danger. First the lack of water, then too much water
damaged your valley. A few acres—”</p>

<p>A voice from the crowd cried out, “A few acres?
Thousands of acres.” Instantly others were on their
feet. “Thousands of acres. Ruin.” One man was shouting
himself apoplectic.</p>

<p>Babcock’s gavel sounded a sharp staccato on the table.</p>

<p>“Thousands of acres.” De la Vega was unruffled.
“And more than that. The valley, it must be remembered,
does not stop at the line. Mexican lands, too,
have been scoured by the action, the result of the action
of your irrigation company. It was a mutual,” he paused,
and a quaint word came to his need. “A mutual bereavement.
It did not occur to us to accuse you of our troubles.
Your damage suits pained and astonished us. But
they gave us also a suggestion.”</p>

<p>The rustling and the murmurs suddenly ceased. A
prescient hush waited on De la Vega. “You have been
advised to sue us. To sue us for giving you that concession.
Therefore, the only answer is for us to withdraw
that concession! You accuse us, for giving it to
you. That concession is valuable. What else <i>can</i> we do?
Before your damage suits were filed, we were approached
by others for the same privilege. If you do not withdraw
your suits, my nation sends word to you that you
may not take water from the Colorado River through
Mexican soil. You will not be without water probably
long; I have said that concession is valuable! Other
arrangements will probably be made so that the valley
will be given water. I would like to take your answer
to my government.”</p>

<p>It was several seconds before the house got its breath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
The import of the diplomat’s words was astounding.
Barton got to his feet, yelling with his great bass voice,
“Betrayed!” His shrunken finger indicated a youth with
“R. S.” in black letters on his collar. “The valley has
been betrayed.”</p>

<p>In the balcony, the uproar was deafening. Around
Hardin and Brandon words were thudding like bullets.
“Reclamation Service.” “That’s their game.” “The concession!”
“They won’t get it.” “Betrayed. We are
betrayed.”</p>

<p>Down-stairs, Babcock’s gavel rapped unheard. Behind
the excited figure wielding the stick, sat Marshall,
his unreadable, sweet smile on his face. His eyes were
on Babcock, who was vainly clamoring for order. “Program
that meeting?”</p>

<p>Hollister was trying to make himself heard to Barton
over two rows of seats, but his voice was like a child’s
on an ocean beach. Barton was surrounded by eager
anxious men. The audience had split into circles of
haranguing centers. It was impossible to get attention.
Hardin could see Marshall pull Babcock by the tails of
his coat. Unwillingly, he could see Babcock allow the
crowd five minutes by his consulted watch. Then again,
the gavel danced on the table. Marshall was still smiling.
Babcock’s shrill voice split the din. “Order.” The ocean
of voices swallowed him again.</p>

<p>“We won’t let them in,” Grace was bellowing, “the
valley won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“Take your medicine,” thundered the big organ of
Barton. “I warned you, Imperial Valley.”</p>

<p>“Betrayal,” groaned the crowd.</p>

<p>“A pretty international block.” Brandon was smiling,
too. This was better than he had expected. A rattling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
good story the <i>Sun</i> would have. Bertha would read
it over her breakfast rolls. “This is history.”</p>

<p>Down in the orchestra, Barton was holding a hurry-up
meeting of the water companies. De la Vega had stepped
back and was consulting with Tod Marshall.</p>

<p>Babcock pulled out his watch, his gavel calling for
attention. This time he was heard.</p>

<p>De la Vega approached the footlights, a questioning
look on his face.</p>

<p>“We ask for a little time,” began Barton. Instantly
the house was on its feet. “Withdraw the suits. Give
him your answer. Give him our answer. We don’t want
the Service. The valley don’t want the Service. Withdraw
the suits.”</p>

<p>Barton’s moon face looked troubled. “We can’t answer
for all the ranchers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can,” screamed Grace, jumping up and down
like a baboon. “If you don’t, I’ll answer for them. Don’t
you see, it’s a trick? It’s a trick. I see the hand of the
O. P. in this.” Friendly hands pulled him down into
his seat.</p>

<p>The audience was chanting. “Withdraw the suits.
Take your medicine.—Don’t lose the concession.—Lord,
the Service!—Give them the answer, now.”</p>

<p>Barton held up a withered hand. The undeveloped
body was dignified by the splendid head. “Don’t withdraw
your concession. I think I can say that Mexico
will not be sued.”</p>

<p>Again, the shout went up. “Answer like a man.
Think! Good lord! Say we withdraw the suits!”</p>

<p>“We withdraw the claims against Mexico.” Barton
sat down to a sudden hush. The first blood had been let.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>Once more Babcock’s glasses swept the house. He
rapped the table.</p>

<p>“That’s not all. We’ve got more to say to you. Gentlemen,
Mr. Marshall.”</p>

<p>Marshall stepped forward to a silence which was a
variety of tribute.</p>

<p>He bowed. “I will be brief. Mr. Faraday has asked
me to take his place here this afternoon. It’s only fair.
If it were not for my interference, he would not be involved
in this situation. I think you will grant that it is
Mr. Faraday’s company which can save the valley?”</p>

<p>“To save its own tracks!” yelled a voice from the
balcony.</p>

<p>Marshall sent a soft smile heavenward. “Incidentally.
And its traffic. Why don’t you say it? We don’t deny
that. The Overland Pacific’s no altruist.”</p>

<p>There was a jeer which rose into a chorus. “Altruist!
Octopus. That’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Marshall’s hand went up. “If you want to hear me?”
He waved away Babcock’s descending gavel. “I was
told it would cost two hundred thousand dollars to close
that break of yours. Do you want the actual figures?
It has eaten already a million, and the work is not
yet done. You know the history of the undertaking.
The Desert Reclamation Company was in straits. Faraday
promised his help on the condition that the affairs
of the Desert Reclamation Company would be controlled
by his company. He took the control. He inherited—what?
Not good will. Threats, damage suits. Do you
think that snow-slide of complaints is going to encourage
him to go on? This is what I came here to talk to you
about. You ranchers don’t want to cut your own throat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Now, there’s a good deal going on about which you are
in the dark. Faraday’s got a right to feel he’s shouldered
an old man of the sea. He’s been trying to dislodge
it. He’s appealed to the president. Ever since we came
into this, the cry from Washington has been, ‘Do this the
way we like, or we’ll not take it off your hands.’” A
murmur of angry voices started somewhere, swelling
toward the balcony.</p>

<p>“We don’t want the government—” began the rising
voices. Marshall’s voice rang out:</p>

<p>“But the government wants—you! Unless you will
help save your own homes, the government will have to,
in time. It’s got to. Up there at Laguna, have you seen
it? There’s nothing going on. They’re watching us.
That’s a useless toy if our works are washed out. Faraday
says <i>this</i> to you—” Not a sound in the stilled house.
“Unless you withdraw your damage suits, he won’t advance
another damned cent.”</p>

<p>Sharply he sat down before the audience realized that
his message was finished. The house had not found its
voice, when Babcock’s gavel was pounding again for attention.
The question, he felt, had not been put to them
completely. Perhaps, they did not gather the full import
of Mr. Marshall’s message. Mr. MacLean would follow
Mr. Marshall.</p>

<p>MacLean’s superb figure rose from a tree-paneled
background.</p>

<p>“He should sing <i>Brown October Ale</i>,” suggested
Brandon to Hardin humorously.</p>

<p>Hardin’s eyes were on MacLean. What did he know
about it? What could he tell those men that they did not
know? MacLean was a figurehead in the reorganized
irrigation company. Why hadn’t they called on him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
Hardin? He knew more about the involved history of
the two companies than the whole bunch on the stage
down yonder. He could have told them, he could have
called on their justice, their memory—</p>

<p>MacLean was speaking.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marshall has likened the river project to the old
man of the sea. He has it on his back, while it is busily
kicking him in the shins!</p>

<p>“Mr. Marshall has given you Mr. Faraday’s message.
He has asked you to dismiss your damage suits. I ask
you to do more than that. Put your hands in your
pockets! Come out and help us. You don’t want the
government. I am told that is the sentiment of the
valley. When you called to them, they wouldn’t help
you; they wouldn’t give you an adequate price. Congress
will soon be adjourning. What is Mr. Faraday
to say to Washington? Is he going to close that break?
That depends on you. Withdraw your suits. Do more.
Stop fighting against us. Fight <i>with</i> us—”</p>

<p>The audience stirred ominously, angrily. Before MacLean
was done, a voice screamed from the balcony. “You
can’t quit. That’s a threat. You’re in too deep. You
can’t fool us. You’ve got to save yourself. You’ve got
to go on. Tell Faraday to tell that to Washington.”</p>

<p>The uproar was released. Black, from the Wistaria,
jumped on his chair. “I am speaking for the valley.
We can’t help. You know it. We’re stripped. We’re
ruined. You think to threaten us with the government—if
we wait for the government to decide, the valley is
gone—and the railroad’s money with it. I tell you, your
bluff won’t go. We want justice. We are going to have
justice.”</p>

<p>“Justice!” came from the surging ranchers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Fair play,” yelled Black. “You can’t trick us. We
were not born yesterday. We have rights. The company
brought us here. What did we give our money
for? Desert land? What good is this land without
water? We bought water—we were pledged water. Give
us back the money we’ve put in—that’s what we’re asking
for. We won’t be scared out of our rights.”</p>

<p>There was a growling accompaniment from the back
rows, herding together.</p>

<p>“Order,” cried Babcock, thumping his gavel. “Let
Mr. Black have the floor.”</p>

<p>Black had not stopped. Wildly his hands cut the air.
His speech, though high-pitched, had a prepared sound;
it worked toward a climax. He gave individual instances
of ruin. “Grace, Willard Grace, his crop gone,
his place cut in two. Hollister and Wilson, of the Palo
Verde, the ranch a screaming horror. Scores of others.”
He would not mention his own case; and then he itemized
his misfortunes. Parrish, his place scoured beyond
all future usefulness. What had they come into the valley
for? Who had urged them? There were pledges
of the D. R., water pledges. That was all those ruined
men were pleading, the redemption of those pledges. Individual
ruin, what did it mean? A curtailing of luxuries,
of personal indulgence. “I tell you, it means food,
bread, potatoes; milk for the babies; or starvation.”</p>

<p>Black had touched the deep note. This was the answer.
This was what they wanted to say.</p>

<p>“You ask us to help you, us, we who are taxed already
to our breaking point. You say your company won’t
go any further. What does that help mean to you?
Poverty? A few thousands, a million to the O. P., a
corporation, what does a loss mean to them? Poverty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
I tell you, no. A smaller dividend, maybe, to whom?
Yes, to whom? To the men who live in Fifth Avenue,
whose wives are dragged about in limousines. Withdraw
their suits? Help Faraday, and ruin men like
Parrish? Men of the valley, what is your answer to
Faraday?”</p>

<p>The crowd was on its feet, swaying and pushing. The
air was fetid with breaths. Wilson’s crowd had forgotten
its lorgnettes. “No,” yelled the ranchers. “We
say, no.”</p>

<p>A boy made his way from the wings, a yellow envelope
in his hand.</p>

<p>Babcock waved him on to Marshall. The audience
was crying itself hoarse. Babcock lost control of the
meeting in that minute of turning. Hollister, of the
Palo Verde, was striving to be heard; Babcock’s hammer
sounded in vain. But Marshall’s eye had caught a spark
from the yellow sheet. He sprang forward, throwing
the despatch toward MacLean. His excitement caught
the eye of the crowd. “The river!” There was a sudden
hush. “The river’s out again!” A groan swept through
the house, there was a break toward the doors.</p>

<p>Marshall’s voice halted them. “Men of the valley.”
The audience, swayed again, listened. “Hear me. The
river’s running away again down yonder. This is a
message from Rickard. It’s broken through the levee.
It’s started for the valley. Now, who’s going to stop
it? Who can stop it? Can you? Where’s your force,
your equipment? Who can rush to that call but the company
you are hounding? I gave you Faraday’s message.
His hand’s on the table. Not another cent from him
unless you withdraw those suits. You say you have
given me your answer, Black’s answer. Now the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
plays a trick. It calls your bluff. Shall we stop the river,
men of the valley? We can. Will you withdraw your
suits? You can. What is your answer now, Imperial
Valley?”</p>

<p>The scene broke into bedlam. Men jumped to their
chairs, to the velvet rim of the boxes, all talking, screaming,
gesticulating at once. The <i>Yellow Dragon</i> was never
so fearfully visualized. Out of the chaos of men’s voices
came a woman’s shriek, “For God’s sake, save our
homes.” It pitched the panic note. “Save the valley!
Stop the river!”</p>

<p>Marshall’s Indian eyes were reading that mass of
scared faces as though it were a sheet of typed paper.
“Barton,” he called through the din. “Where’s Barton?”</p>

<p>Two men lifted Barton’s puny figure upon their shoulders.
His vibrant voice rolled above the shouting. “The
valley withdraws its suits against the company.”</p>

<p>“Then the company,” yelled Marshall’s oratory, “the
company withdraws the river from the valley!” Pandemonium
was loose. There were cheers, and the sound
of women sobbing. Barton was carried out on the shoulders
of his henchmen. Black led a crowd out, haranguing
to the street. Morton’s party waited for the house to
empty. De la Vega, from the wings, watched the scene
with polite curiosity.</p>

<p>Picking their way past a painted side shift of merry
England, MacLean and Babcock followed Marshall from
the stage.</p>

<p>On the street, Marshall fell back to MacLean. “That
was a neat trick the river threw in our hands.” His voice
had dropped from oratory; the declaiming fire was gone
from the black eyes. “It’s only a break in the levee.
Rickard says he can control it; estimates two weeks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
so. It may cost the O. P. a few thousand dollars, but it
saved them half a million. Now we’ll have that game
of poker, MacLean!”</p>

<p>In the balcony, Hardin was staring at Brandon.</p>

<p>“If that wasn’t the devil’s own luck!”</p>

<small>A SOFT NOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INNES traveled, gleefully, in a caboose, from Hamlin
Junction to the Heading. She could not stay
away a day longer! Never before had Los Angeles been
a discipline. Her surprise was still fresh over the change
in her friends, two girls who had been her comrades
during her unfinished college course. She had left, in
the spirit of self-sacrifice, to look after Tom. They had
finished, but their two years of wifehood had made a
wider gap than her break. Their plans of individual accomplishment
all merged into new curtains for the guest
chamber, and surprise dishes for Tom and Harry! Why
had it fretted her, made her restless, homesick? Then
she had discovered the reason; history was going on
down yonder. Going on, without her. She knew that
that was what was pulling her; that only!</p>

<p>The exodus of engineers had started riverward in July.
Gerty went with Tom, and she had made it distinctly
clear that it was not necessary for Innes to follow them.
Ridiculous for two women to coddle a Tom Hardin!
Unless Innes had a special interest!</p>

<p>Her pride had kept her away. But Tom did not write;
Gerty’s letters were social and unsatisfactory; the newspaper
reports inflamed her. The day before she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
wired Tom that she was coming. She had to be there
at the end!</p>

<p>There was no one to meet her. Tom was down on
the levee work; the camp was deserted. She found her
way to the Hardin tents, helped by the Chinese cook
whom she found installed behind a clump of mesquits.</p>

<p>Gerty welcomed her stiffly. Assuming a conscientious
hostess-ship, she caught fire at her waning enthusiasms.
The arrangement of the tent, of the simple furniture, did
not Innes find it sweet? That smaller tent to the west
of theirs had been added that morning. A Mexican was
even then carrying in a wash-stand and an iron bed. Outside,
in a hand-cart, were a couple of chairs, a basin and
pitcher of gray enamel.</p>

<p>“If we had known you were coming, we would have
been ready for you,” suggested Gerty.</p>

<p>Innes’ gaze had been turning outward to the lines of
canvas, making a white glitter on the alkali floor of the
encampment, trapezium in shape. Stark in outline, vivid
in color, she saw the desert again as a savage; her terms,
brutal, uncompromising. But were they taking her on
her terms, these intruders? They were making her over
to their wishes, as a man makes unto his liking the wife
of his satisfied choice? She was following a thought
born of her late visit. Strange, the zeal which would
remake the sweetheart, thought peerless! Her mouth
curved with ironic tenderness. Gerty’s treble notes fell
around her ears. She was listening to her own musing,
and watching the dripping arm of the dredge as it dug
a trap for the Colorado.</p>

<p>The prattle grew insistent, interrogative. She had to
look at shelves, at cupboards, at a clever ramada which
was both pergola and porch. Returning to the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
tent, she went back to the door, her Hardin pulse leaping
to the implication of that dredge-arm swinging low
in the river.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it all cozy?” Gerty’s eyes shone on her contrivances.
“It all means work. It has taken two whole
months to get it to look like this. Every piece of lumber
had to be coaxed for, and you’d think the carpenter was
a ward boss, he’s that haughty.”</p>

<p>Gerty looked younger and prettier. Her flush accented
her childish features which were smiling down
her annoyance over this uninvited visit.</p>

<p>“I had the ramada put up after the shed; an afterthought.
They gave me a tent for a kitchen at first—as
if I could cook in a tent! We eat in the ramada. The
flies ate us up, so I sent for screen wire, and had it enclosed.
It isn’t perfect, but it’s much better than it was.
The flies will get through that roof. It keeps one busy
to remember to have fresh brush piled over it. It dries
so quickly in this sun. Isn’t it hot here? Hotter than
the towns ever were; don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Innes said she had not been there long enough yet to
tell!</p>

<p>“We have all the home comforts, haven’t we?” Innes’
gaze swept the disguised tent with its home-made
sketches and cushions and <i>art-nouveau</i> lamp-shades—even
the green mandarin skirt had found a place on the
center-table made of rough pine. “Why shouldn’t we
be comfortable when we are to be here for months? I’m
going to brave it out—to the bitter end, even if I bake.
It is my duty—” She would make her intention perfectly
clear! “There ought to be at least one cozy place,
one soft nook that suggests a woman’s presence. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
have tea here in the afternoon, sometimes. Mr. Rickard
drops in.” The last was a delicate stroke.</p>

<p>“Afternoon tea? At the Front? Is this modern warfare?”
The girl draped her irony with a smile.</p>

<p>“Warfare? What do you mean?” Gerty turned from
the new chafing-dish and percolator she had intended
showing to Innes.</p>

<p>“I thought this was a battle.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for having a pleasant corner to
rest in,” triumphed Mrs. Hardin. “And the comfort the
men take in it, the Service men especially! By the way,
Innes, I met Mr. Estrada on the <i>Delta</i> last evening and
told him you were coming. I asked him to take you over
the encampment. He was perfectly willing to do it, although
it’s an old story to all of them, now. You’ve no
idea how many newspaper men have been down here. It’s
been quite exciting.” She caught herself in time to add:
“Though it has been unendurably hot! This is a model
camp, as you will see. That’s why Mr. Rickard can get
such work out of his men; he has made them so comfortable.”</p>

<p>“You need not have gone to so much trouble—” Innes
told herself that she was perverse. Just peevishness to
dislike plans being made for her! Gerty’s polite sentences
had a way of ruffling her. She ought not to suspect
deviousness.</p>

<p>Gerty was stealing a pleased survey in the mirror
through the rough door that opened into the division
called her bedroom. The sunburned, unconscious profile
of Innes was close to her own. Pink and golden the
head by the dark one. She looked younger even than
Innes! Good humor returned to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“We are going to dine on the <i>Delta</i> to-night.” She
pinned up a “scolding lock,” an ugly misnomer for her
sunny clinging curls! The mirror was requisitioned
again. “That’s the name of the new dredge. It was
christened three weeks ago, in champagne brought from
Yuma.”</p>

<p>“You christened it?” Innes, following a surmise,
stumbled on a grievance.</p>

<p>“No!” sharply. Then a minute later, “They’d asked
Mrs. Silent, old man Hamlin’s daughter. I suppose Mr.
Rickard thought he had to. Mr. Hamlin’s the pioneer
here, he’s such a dreadful old man. Besides, they’re always
asking the men up to dinner. They can get a real
<i>meal</i> there,—Mrs. Silent has a stove, and they keep
chickens.” She frowned toward the chafing-dish and
percolator; stern limitations theirs!</p>

<p>“You said <i>dine</i> on the <i>Delta</i>. Do you mean they have
meals there?”</p>

<p>“You should see it,” cooed Gerty. “It’s simply elegant.
It’s a floating hotel, has every convenience. Some
of the young engineers have a sort of club there, they
have brought in their own cook from Los Angeles. The
camp cook, Ling, has his hands full. He does very well,
but it must be very rough. The <i>Delta</i> has worked
things up here.”</p>

<p>“Going to wear that?” They were standing now by
the door of Gerty’s dressing tent. Over the bed a white
lingerie gown was spread.</p>

<p>“I live in them. It’s so hot,” shrugged Mrs. Hardin.</p>

<p>“However do you manage to get them washed?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin did not think it necessary to relate her
struggles, nor her chagrin to find that no one thought
important the delivery of her weekly wash to Yuma.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Only because she would resent possible comment did she
refrain from recounting her trials with Indian washerwomen.
She recalled some tattered experiments that
she had made—</p>

<p>“I’ll look like your maid, Gerty!” Innes’ exclamation
was rueful. “I didn’t bring anything but khakis.”</p>

<p>“If that isn’t just like you, Innes Hardin!”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought of you as living in the most primitive
way; as roughing it! Oh, yes! I remember throwing in,
the last minute, two piqués to fill up space. But I never
dreamed I’d need them.”</p>

<p>“Why, we have dances on the <i>Delta</i>, and Sunday
evening concerts; you’ll be surprised how gay we are.
You knew the work at Laguna Dam is being held up?
The government men of the Reclamation Service are
down here all the time. But it’s time to be getting
ready.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be ashamed of your sister. Tom’s going, of
course?”</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘of course’ about Tom, he does just as
he feels like.”</p>

<p>Later, Tom flatly refused to accompany them.</p>

<p>“I thought as much.” Gerty shrugged an airy irresponsibility.
Innes could detect no regret.</p>

<p>“Where will you get your dinner?” His sister was
uncertain how far she might venture into this domestic
situation.</p>

<p>“Oh, anywhere,” brusked Tom.</p>

<p>“At the mess-table, the regular eating tent. He usually
goes there when there is a dinner at the <i>Delta</i>. He
doesn’t dance, you know.”</p>

<p>They passed a cot outside the tent. “Who sleeps
there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Tom.” The eyes of the two women did not meet.</p>

<p>Innes made no comment.</p>

<p>“He finds the tent stuffy.” Gerty’s lips were prim
with reserve. They walked toward the river in silence.
As they reached the encampment, Gerty recovered her
vivacity.</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Rickard’s office, that ramada. Isn’t it
quaint? And that’s his tent; no, the other one. MacLean’s
is next; we all call him Junior now. The kitchen’s
behind those mesquit trees. They gave the only shade
in the camp to the cook!” She made a grimace men
would have found adorable, lost quite on Innes Hardin.</p>

<p>“There’s Junior, now,” dimpled Gerty Hardin.</p>

<p>But his eyes were too full of Innes to see mature
dimples. His boyishness lacked tact. It was nearly three
months since he had seen her; a desert of days, those!
The difference in the quality of his greetings smote
Gerty like a blow. Until her mirror told her differently
she would feel youthful. And she had never considered
Tom’s sister attractive, as a possible rival. Yet, after a
handshake, she saw that to MacLean, Jr., she did not
exist.</p>

<p>A boat was anchored to a pile on the muddy stream.
MacLean jumped in. “I’ll hold it steady.”</p>

<p>Innes scrambled past his waiting hand, and steadied
herself toward the stern. “I’ll steer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin and her lace ruffles were placed carefully
in the bow.</p>

<p>“Can you climb up that ladder?” MacLean asked
Innes.</p>

<p>“Climb? I’m a cat! Didn’t you know it?”</p>

<p>A group of welcoming faces was bending over the
rail as they drew up in the shadow of the dredge. Innes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
was on the ladder before MacLean could secure the boat.
She had disappeared with the welcoming young engineers
who had much to show her, before Mrs. Hardin
and her lace ruffles were over the side.</p>

<p>Gerty was deeply piqued. Until now, the field had
been hers, divided distantly by the Silent kitchen. She
might perhaps have to change her opinion of Tom’s
sister. Boys, she had to concede, the younger men,
might find her attractive, boyishly congenial; older men
would fail to see a charm!</p>

<p>The arrangement at table annoyed Gerty. The boss,
MacLean explained gaily, would not be there for dinner.
He had been called down the levee, taking Irish with
him. He might come in later. Two men from the
Reclamation Service tried to entertain Mrs. Hardin.</p>

<p>“Did you get Jose Cordoza?” demanded Bodefeldt
under cover of a rush of voices, and then crimsoned
because every one stopped to listen to him.</p>

<p>“He promised to bring his guitar, and to get a friend
who has a mandolin, if the strings are not broken!”
laughed Crothers of the railroad.</p>

<p>“Cordoza plays wonderfully!” cried Mrs. Hardin. “If
I were eighty, I could dance to his waltzes!”</p>

<p>“The deck’s ripping,” cried MacLean, his eyes still
full of Innes Hardin, “and in the moonlight it’s a
pippin!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a battle.” Innes looked around the gay rectangle.
“It’s play!”</p>

<p>The thought followed her that evening. Outside,
where the moonlight was silvering the deck, and the
quiet river lapped the sides of the dredge, Jose’s strings,
and his “<i>amigo’s</i>” throbbing from a dark corner, made
the illusion of peace convincing. This was no battle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Breck, of the Reclamation Service, was dancing with
her. The modern complexity of the situation fell away
from her; the purpose of the <i>Delta</i>, of the gathering
army of laborers, of the pile-drivers in the river, was
obscured. The concentrating struggle against the marauding
Dragon of the Colorado delta, that was the illusion.
It was easy to believe herself again at Mare
Island, or Annapolis—the <i>Delta</i> a cruiser, and young
Breck one of Uncle Sam’s sailors.</p>

<p>Later, Gerty passed her, two-stepping divinely. Before
her partner turned his head, Innes recognized the
stiff back and straight poised head and dancing step of
Rickard. Every muscle in control; it was the distinction
of the man. She admitted he had distinction, grudgingly.
She could not think of him except comparatively; always
antithetically, balanced against her Tom. She wished
Tom would not slouch so. Tom had all the big virtues,
none of his faults was petty. But he was being nagged
into unloveliness.</p>

<p>“I’m tired; let’s rest here.” She drew into the shadow
of the great arm of the dredge. They watched the
dancers as they passed, MacLean playing the woman in
“Pete’s” arms, Gerty with Rickard, two other masculine
couples. The Hardins were the only women aboard.</p>

<p>It was because of Tom that Innes felt resentment when
the uplifted appealing chin, the lace ruffles fluttered by.
Tom, lying outside an unfriendly tent!</p>

<p>“Don’t they dance superbly?” Breck’s eyes were following
the couple, too.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s dance.” She pretended not to hear
him.</p>

<p>It was easy, in that uncertain light, to avoid Rickard’s
glance of recognition. Estrada, who had come aboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
with the manager, sought her out, and then Crothers, of
the O. P. Again, she saw Rickard dancing with the
lingerie gown. There seemed to be no attempt to cover
Gerty’s preference; for Rickard, she was the only woman
there! Because she was Tom’s sister, she had a right
to resent it, to refuse to meet his eye. Small wonder
Tom did not come to the <i>Delta</i>!</p>

<p>Going in with MacLean, Jr., to the mess room for a
glass of water, she met Rickard, on his way out. She
managed to avoid shaking hands with him. She wondered
why she had consented to give him the next waltz.</p>

<p>“He’ll not find me,” she determined. Whatever had
made her assent? Easy in that womanless group to plead
engagements. She led MacLean into innocent but eager
conspiracy. He followed her gladly to the dark corner
of the deck where Jose’s guitar was then syncopating an
accompaniment to his “<i>amigo’s</i>” voice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>A donde ira veloz y fatigada,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>La golondrina que de aqui se va?</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“How beautiful!” cried Innes. “But how sad.” She
had picked up some Spanish in the towns. “I have never
heard that before.” She leaned over and asked Jose if he
would not write it out for her. Unblushingly, Jose said
he would; “Mañana.”</p>

<p>“Dollars to doughnuts, he can’t write even his own
name!” whispered Junior. “But I’ll see that you get it
mañana!” he added. He would type it for; anything
she wanted, he would get for her!</p>

<p>To her surprise, Rickard penetrated her curtain of
shadows.</p>

<p>“Our dance, Miss Hardin? Give us <i>Sobr’ Las Olas</i>,
again, Jose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>The hand that barely touched his arm was stiff with
antagonism. He stepped off at once to the music; they
had no points of contact, these two. No eager threads
of talk to be picked up and turned into a pattern. She
told herself that he had to dance with her—politeness,
conventionality, demanded it. But, instantly, she forgot
her resentment, and forgot their awkward relation. It
was his dancing, not Gerty’s, then, that was “superb.”
Anybody could find skill under the leadership of that
irresistible step. She was just an ordinary dancer, yet
she felt as though she had acquired grace and skill. And
then the motion claimed her. She thought of nothing;
they moved as one to the liquid falling heat. She passed
Estrada, just arrived. His smile fell past her. He stood
watching them. The girl was not talking. He could not
make out the still fixity of her face.</p>

<p>The music dropped them suddenly, isolating them at
the stern of the deck. The silence was complete. It
was a moment of unreality, the rhythmic blood still in
motion, the wistfulness of the moonlight falling on peaceful
waters. Rickard broke it to ask her what she thought
of the camp.</p>

<p>Her resentments were recalled. She blundered
through her impression of the lightness, the gaiety.</p>

<p>“So you think we ought to be solemn?” His tone
teased her. The eyes that always confused Gerty were
on her. She again tried to be vocal.</p>

<p>“It does not suggest a battle-ground, I mean. The
talk to-night at table, the dancing, the fun! It does not
seem like a battle camp—”</p>

<p>“You’ve been in a battle camp, Miss Hardin?”</p>

<p>She would not be flouted. “The atmosphere—it’s a
camp vacation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“A work camp does not have to be solemn. You’ll
find all the grimness you want if you look beneath the
surface.” She thought, later, of what she might have
said to him, but then she stood silent, feeling like a silly
child under his light mockery.</p>

<p>The guitars were tuning up. “Shall I take you back?
I have this dance with your sister.”</p>

<p>She thought of Tom—on his lonely cot outside his
tent. She forgot that she had been asked a question.
He was dancing again with Gerty! If that silly little
woman had no scruples, no fine feeling, this man should
at least guard her. If he had been her lover, he should
be careful; he must see that people were talking of
them. She had seen the glances that evening! The
business relation between the two men should suggest
tact, if not decency! It was outrageous.</p>

<p>Rickard stood waiting to be dismissed; puzzled.
Through the uncertain light, her anger came to him. She
looked taller, older; there was a flame of accusing passion
in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was his minute of revelation. So that was what the
camp thought! The wife of Hardin—Hardin! Why,
he’d been only polite to her—they were old friends. What
had he said to call down this sudden scorn? “Dancing—again—”
Had he been all kinds of an ass?</p>

<p>“My turn, Miss Innes!” demanded MacLean, Jr.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she cried, relief in her tone.</p>

<p>Rickard did not claim his dance with Mrs. Hardin.
He stood where the girl had left him, thinking. A few
minutes later, Gerty swept by in the arms of Breck. Her
light laughter, the laughter that had made the Lawrence
table endurable, came to him in his unseen corner. Later,
came Innes with Junior; the two, thinking themselves unseen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
romping through a two-step like two young children.
He was never shown that side of her. Gay as a
young kitten, chatting merrily with MacLean! Should
her eyes discover him, she would be again the haughty
young woman!</p>

<p>He’d gone out of his way to be polite to the wife of
Hardin. What did he care what they thought? He’d
finish his job, and get out.</p>

<p>The sound of oars came to him; the splashing of
waves against the dredge. He leaned over. A boat was
tying by the ladder.</p>

<p>“Hi, below!” called Rickard.</p>

<p>“Come for Mr. Crothers,” the voice from the shadows
answered. “He told me to come for him at ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” Rickard was clambering over the side.
“I’m Rickard. I’ve got to get back to camp. You can
come again for Crothers.”</p>

<p>A minute later, he was being rowed back to camp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE STOKERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“COMPLETE, isn’t it?” Estrada was leading Innes
Hardin through the engineers’ quarters.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s <i>complete</i>!”</p>

<p>Her brother had told her at breakfast that morning
how grandly they had been wasting time! She would
not let herself admire the precision of the arrangements,
the showers back of the white men’s quarters, the
mesquit-shaded kitchen. Gerty’s elaborate settling was
of a piece, it would seem, with the new management.
Housekeeping, not fighting, then, the new order of
things!</p>

<p>Tom was afire to get his gate done. She knew what
it meant to him; to the valley. The flood waters had
to be controlled. That depended, Tom had proved to
her, on the gate. And the men dance and play house,
as if they were children, and every day counting!</p>

<p>She thought she was keeping her accusations to herself,
but Estrada was watching her face.</p>

<p>“We are here, you know, for a siege. There are
months of work ahead, hot months, hard months. The
men have got to be kept well and contented. We can’t
lose any time by sickness”— He wanted to add “and
dissensions.” The split camp was painful to him, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Estrada. “Even after we finish the gate, if we do finish
it—”</p>

<p>She wheeled on him, her eyes gleaming like deep
yellow jewels. “You’ve never thought we could finish
it!”</p>

<p>Estrada hesitated over his answer.</p>

<p>“You are a friend of Tom’s, Mr. Estrada?”</p>

<p>“Surely! But I am also an admirer of Mr. Rickard,
I mean of his methods. I can never forget the levee.”</p>

<p>She had to acknowledge that Rickard had scored there.
And the burning of the machinery had left a wound
that she still must salve.</p>

<p>“You have no confidence in the gate?”</p>

<p>“The conditions have changed,” urged Estrada.
“You’ve seen the mess-tent? As it was planned, it was
all right, a hurry-up defense. Marshall all along intended
the concrete gate for the permanent intake. Have
you seen the gap the Hardin gate is to close? Have
you heard what the last floods did to it? It’s now
twenty-six hundred feet, and Disaster Island, which your
brother planned to anchor to, swept away! If it can
be done, it will, you can rest assured, with Rickard—”
he saw the Hardin mouth then!—“and your brother’s
zeal, and the strength of the railroad back of them.
I haven’t shown you the office yet. Can you stand this
glare? You ought to have smoked glasses.”</p>

<p>“I have. I forgot them.” She pulled her wide Mexican
brim low over her eyes.</p>

<p>The camp formed a hollow trapezium; the Hardins’
tents, and Mrs. Dowker’s, were isolated on the short
parallel. Rickard’s ramada and his tent were huddled
with the engineers’. Across, toward the river, behind
Ling’s mesquits, began another polygon, the camp of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
foremen and white labor. Some of these tents were
empty.</p>

<p>“Is this Mexico, or the states?” asked Innes.</p>

<p>“Mexico.” She wondered why he halted so abruptly.
She did not see, for the glare in her eyes, a woman’s
skirt in the ramada they approached.</p>

<p>Estrada marched on.</p>

<p>Outside the ramada, the two women met. Gerty’s
step carried her past like a high-bred horse. Her high
heels cut into the hard sand. There was a suggestion
of prance in her mien. She waved her hand gaily at
the two, cried, “How hot it is!” and passed on.</p>

<p>Innes saw Rickard at his long pine table used for a
desk.</p>

<p>“I can see it all from here.” Not for money would
the sister of Tom Hardin go in!</p>

<p>Estrada saw by her face that the hope of conciliating
the ex-manager by the sister was a false trail. She
threw a curt nod to MacLean whom her glance just
caught.</p>

<p>“Where are we going now?”</p>

<p>“I’m planning a trip to Arizona!” he returned. “You
think this is all play. Now I’m going to show you the
‘stokers.’”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, he called out to her: “Step
high!”</p>

<p>She looked at the ground, and then inquiringly at
him. The ground was as flat as a hardwood floor.</p>

<p>“You are crossing the line,” he announced. “You
are now in Arizona.”</p>

<p>“I thought the Indian camp was in Mexico, too?”</p>

<p>“No, across the river to avoid custom’s duty. See
those roofs of boughs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>He was making for a knoll from whence they could get
a view of the river, and of the Hardin gate.</p>

<p>Her memory isolated a word of his. “The stokers—who
are they?”</p>

<p>“We call them that. The brush-cutters. They look
for all the world like the poor wretches in the ship’s
engine-room.”</p>

<p>“Indians?”</p>

<p>“I wish they were. No, Mexicans. Rickard couldn’t
get enough Indians, and Mexicans can’t stand this.”</p>

<p>Beyond them stretched the river of yellow waters,
dividing like the letter Y, the east branch the dry bed
of the Colorado. From a distance they could see the
great arm of the dredge drop into the mud of the new
channel, by which the water was to be diverted through
the Hardin gate. Innes watched the bucket rise, dripping
with soft silt, saw the elbow crook as the arm
swung slowly toward the bank.</p>

<p>“That’s where you danced last night,” he observed.</p>

<p>“I thought I was on a cruiser!”</p>

<p>“A cruiser’s also a battle-ship!”</p>

<p>A hot sweet smell rose from the bank. She thought
her sudden sway of faintness was from the sun.</p>

<p>“It’s too much for you. That’s the arrow-weed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve smelt arrow-weed before. This is different.”</p>

<p>“Not in quantity before, Miss Hardin. I shouldn’t
have brought you here. We will go back.”</p>

<p>“Is this what they are cutting?”</p>

<p>“They’re the stokers.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see them.” Her eyes questioned the mat
of undergrowth.</p>

<p>“You can’t.”</p>

<p>She could not detect a human figure moving in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
clot of branches. Then she caught the gleam of a machete.
A face peered from an opening, blackened and
strangling. Her cry sounded like pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you see him?” Dripping with sweat, gasping,
it made a horrid sight.</p>

<p>“It’s not all play!” he observed.</p>

<p>“Look what he is doing, no, not that one.” From
the tangle came running a dripping human. He tossed
his hands, staring up at the burning bowl of a sky.
No help there! The sun-baked sands, glittering like
brass, gave no escape. He raised his hands, and they
could see him take the poise of diver; like a projectile
he shot into the pool of living green beneath.</p>

<p>“He thinks it’s water,” whispered Innes.</p>

<p>“<i>He’s</i> got it,” cried Estrada, caught with excitement.
“It’s a madness. One man died yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Died!”</p>

<p>“Why, no white man, for they’re white, those Mexican,
can stand that hole. It’s an inferno. There have
been two deaths already. If another goes, they’ll walk
out. I’ve told Rickard; he knows. They’re superstitious
as niggers—the third death—they’re boiling with
discontent already. Then where’ll we be, where’ll the
gate be?” The graceful indolence of the Cardenas was
gone; he was all Estrada now, vehement and impassioned.</p>

<p>“He may die?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have brought you here!”</p>

<p>He tried to get her away. Her eyes would not leave
that pool of living green, the hole that the poor wretch
had thought was cooling waters. The smell of cut arrow-weed,
sickly sweet, smote against her nostrils. Then
she saw a movement in the undergrowth. A group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
men were pulling him out—she saw his face, distorted,
livid. His lips were chattering; he screamed like a
raucous ape.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“I saw <i>them</i>,” his answer was grim. He watched
them, their composite expression foreboding, as they bore
to camp the struggling madman.</p>

<p>“Is he really mad? Do they get over it?”</p>

<p>“They get over it!” He did not tell her how! To
divert her, he told her that these were the men for whom
Porter had been scouring Zacatecas.</p>

<p>“Mexicans don’t take kindly to a contract when it
means arrow-weed. Rickard’s Indians haven’t come yet,
the men Forestier’s promised; he’s the Indian agent. The
hoboes are still wandering in, but not in the numbers we
expected. Rickard was right. You can’t count on that
sort of labor.”</p>

<p>Rickard was right? She glanced sharply at the beautiful
face of her companion. Then who was wrong? She
was growing sensitive, ready for a slight to hit her
brother.</p>

<p>“If they go, I wouldn’t swap places with Rickard.”
The Mexican was moody.</p>

<p>For the first time, she forgot to notice the incongruity
of his speech. His years at an American college had
given him a vocabulary which belied his nationality. She
was resenting his concern. Every one thinking of Rickard!
What responsibility was his? He was here to
direct the work, but if it failed, was the stigma not all
her brother’s? She flamed into speech.</p>

<p>“It’s a snap for him, for Mr. Rickard,” she cried. “All
the pioneering, the breaking of earth has been <i>done</i>!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Your father, Mr. Estrada, and my brother paved the
way for him. With the entire equipment of a great
organization like the O. P. behind him—money, men,
everything, it isn’t fair. He’ll walk in and win, and the
world will think he did it.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t like it to fail, would you? And it’s
not so easy as you think, Miss Hardin.” He was carefully
picking his way. “He’s told he has a free hand, but
he hasn’t. The work’s stopped up there at Laguna;
there’s no use going on with that until we make good.
If we can’t control the river here, their quicksand works
go, but you know that?”</p>

<p>She nodded. Tom had told her all that.</p>

<p>“Those men are swarming in here like bees to honey.
They’ve been told to help, and then they are curious.
They have all got ideas of their own. And they’re talking
and writing to the higher-ups. It all gets back to
Rickard, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have to please them,” murmured the girl.</p>

<p>“Not directly. But the O. P. didn’t go into this forever!
The road was the most deeply interested corporation
with power. Marshall got Faraday to promise to
put up the money. He promised to make it good with his
own money if he couldn’t stop the river. I heard this
on the inside! But he wanted it stopped his way. He
wanted his own men in, men who would take his
orders—” he pulled himself away from thin ice. “The
O. P. did not expect to get in as they have. Now, they
can’t get out! The work’s got to please the Service men,
or it won’t be recommended to the government. That’s
what’s tying Rickard up—that, and other things.”</p>

<p>It sounded new to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“And some of these fellows are yelling so, you can hear
them in Washington.” She stole an amused look at him.
How American he was!</p>

<p>They were back at the encampment. Slowly, they
walked across the open space, which was glittering in the
sun. Innes was acknowledging, silently, a headache. The
trip, she said to herself, had depressed her.</p>

<p>When they reached the Hardin tents, she felt obliged
to offer hospitality. “Won’t you come in, Mr. Estrada?
My sister would love to make a cup of tea for you.” She
knew her invitation lacked cordiality. Her temples were
bursting. “It’s an eye headache,” she told herself. “I
should have had my glasses.”</p>

<p>She tried to forget it as she thanked him for “her
trip into Mexico,” and renewed her invitation to tea.</p>

<p>He said he had to go, but he lingered. He said good-by,
and stayed. His look held hers for that instant, the look
she could never fathom. Then he turned away. She
watched him out of sight.</p>

<p>At table, that evening, her family heard with surprise
Gerty’s announcement that they were to eat in the mess-tent
with the men. It was too hot to cook any longer;
this had been one of the hottest days in the year.</p>

<p>“Let me cook!” urged Innes. “It’s only fair. And I
want to do something to justify my being here.” Her
words recurred to Gerty later.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the autumn heat is the worst. Besides,
it is all arranged. We begin to-morrow. You heard too,
then, what Mr. Rickard said about not wanting women
in camp?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not! But to be here without doing anything,
just being one more mouth to feed, and head to
cover—I’d feel more comfortable,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“He gave it out in the towns that he did not want
men’s wives or families following them to the Heading.
He made an exception for Mrs. Parrish—she was too
timid to leave, and Mrs. Dowker, and, of course, it was
different with me.”</p>

<p>Innes felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“It’s all right being with Tom,” she began.</p>

<p>“Why is it all right? Who am I?” He lifted his eyes
from his plate. It came home to Innes that it was not his
camp any longer. She thought, then, that she would go
back to Los Angeles the next week.</p>

<p>She expected to hear a protest to the new arrangement
from Tom. She was to see a new development—sullen
resignation. If he would accept it, she must not
argue. Both sister and brother knew why it was too
warm to cook any longer. Gerty found them both dull.</p>

<p>“That poor Mexican.” She remembered Estrada’s
concern. “The one who went mad? Have you heard
how he was?”</p>

<p>“Dead. The peons are all stampeding.”</p>

<p>“Who’s stampeding?” Gerty came back from a deep
reverie. Lavender, it had just been decided, was to be
the color of the next frock. It was cool and not too positive.
She must remember to send out for samples that
day. She could not recall having heard Rickard express
himself about colors. She wondered if he had preferences
or aversions to shades. He must like green; she
remembered he had admired that mandarin skirt. “And
if the lavender fades, I can rinse it in purple ink.”</p>

<p>Innes was telling Tom of the tragedy of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” cried Gerty, pushing away her plate. “I
can’t hear of such things.” They saw that her pretty
eyes were full of tears. “You know I can’t.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE WHITE OLEANDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. Hardin’s descent on the office that afternoon
was successful, but not satisfactory. She had
found the manager brief to curtness. She was given no
excuse to linger. She traced Rickard’s manner to the
presence of MacLean, and snatched at her cue. She, too,
could be businesslike and brief. Her errand was of
business; her manner should recommend her!</p>

<p>Rickard had seen her making straight toward the
ramada. It was not the first time; her efforts to line her
nest had involved them all and often. But to-day, he
was in a bad humor.</p>

<p>“For the lord’s sake,” he groaned to MacLean as
she approached. “More shelves! I wonder if she thinks
the carpenters have nothing to do but rig up her kitchen
for her?”</p>

<p>MacLean’s grin covered relief. He had never heard
Rickard express himself on the subject before. Could
he believe, he speculated, that her frequent appeals for
assistance were serious? “The dead-set Hardin’s wife
was making at Casey,” was the choice gossip and speculation
of the young engineers on the <i>Delta</i>.</p>

<p>MacLean had a bet up on the outcome. He grinned
more securely.</p>

<p>“I am not going to spare any more carpenters,” growled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Rickard. It was an inauspicious day for Mrs. Hardin’s
visit. Things had gone wrong. Vexations were piling up.
A tilt with Hardin that morning, a telegram from Marshall;
he was feeling sore. Porter’s men had marched
out, carrying their dead. Desperately they needed labor.
Wooster had just reported, venomously, it appeared to
Rickard’s spleen, increasing drunkenness among the
Indians.</p>

<p>Gerty’s ruffles swept in. Her dress, the blue mull with
the lace medallions, accented the hue of her eyes, and
looked deliciously cool that glaring desert day. Her
parasol, of pongee, was lined with the same baby hue.
Her dainty fairness and childish affability should have
made an oasis in that strenuous day, but Rickard’s disintegration
of temper was too complete. He rose stiffly
to meet her, and his manner demanded her errand.</p>

<p>She told it to him, plaintively. It was getting so hot!
Her kitchen was a veritable Turkish bath these days.
At noon, it was terrific. Her eyes were appealing, infantile.</p>

<p>“It’s not shelves.” MacLean’s grin sobered.</p>

<p>Would it be too much to ask, would Mr. Rickard
mind in the least, he must be perfectly frank and tell her
if they would be in the way at all, but while this hot spell
lasted, could they, the three of them, eat in the mess-tent
with the men?</p>

<p>“Surely!” Rickard met it heartily. She would find
it rough, but if she could stand it, yes, he thought it a
good idea. His eagerness suggested relief to one listener.
The Hardins’ meals had been a severe drain on that office.
The new arrangement offered a cessation of petty problems.</p>

<p>Her point so easily gained, she knew she must go. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
acknowledged interrupting business, but there was one
thing more. Would Mr. Rickard tell her how to trace
a lost bundle? If she were at home, of course, she would
not have to ask any one, but here, so far away from
express offices! A package had been sent to her from
Chicago, it must be months ago. It reached the towns
shortly after she left. She had written casually there to
forward it; it had not yet come. She really did not
know how to begin.</p>

<p>“Make a note of that, MacLean,” Rickard volunteered.
He was still standing. “He’ll send a tracer out after it,
Mrs. Hardin.”</p>

<p>And then there was nothing for her to do but go. Her
retreat was graceful, without haste, dignified. There
was a womanly suggestion of business decorum. She
smiled a farewell at MacLean, who was watching the
approach of Innes Hardin and Estrada. The neglected
smile passed on to Rickard, accented. He did not see
the aborted entrance of Hardin’s sister and the young
Mexican. He was itching to be at his work.</p>

<p>He let out a growl when Mrs. Hardin was out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>“What in thunder did she want all those shelves for?
And cupboards and a cooling closet? Every week since
she came, she had to have a carpenter, and I couldn’t
refuse; you know what they’d think, that I was trying
to show my power. Shucks! What in Halifax do
women come to a place like this for? There’s Hardin—brings
in two women to cook for him, and now, please
may they all eat with the men?”</p>

<p>His secretary subdued a chuckle. He was visualizing
a procession of boxes of choice Havanas—from Bodefeldt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Hamlin and the rest of the gang. He need not
buy a smoke for a year.</p>

<p>“Must think this is a summer resort!”</p>

<p>Rickard threw himself back in his chair. “Take this
letter, MacLean. To Marshall.” Then his worry diverted
him. “Who in thunder is selling liquor to my
Indians?”</p>

<p>“Just that way?” quizzed MacLean.</p>

<p>“Hold on; that letter can wait. You get the horses
up, MacLean, and we’ll ride down to Maldonado’s. He’ll
have to get busy, and clear up this thing, or I’ll know
why. I’ll threaten to report him for laziness. It’s his
place to stop this liquor business, not mine.”</p>

<p>A few hours later, they were approaching the adobe
walls of Maldonado. They found the gate locked. A
woman, whose beauty had faded into a tragic whisper,
a ghastly twilight of suggestion, came to their knock,
and unbarred the gate for the white strangers. She left
them by the white oleander whose trunk was like that of
a tree. MacLean sniffed like a young terrier. “What’s
the matter with the place?”</p>

<p>Mystery hung over the enclosure like a pall. Their
voices fell inevitably to a whisper. Once, it had been a
garden; now, only the oleander defied the desert. Dry
ditches told the story of decadence. Once, the river had
wandered by, a stone’s throw away. Maldonado had
turned some of its flow into his adobe court. But the
river channel was dry, and a dead vine clung to the house
walls; fell, shrinking in the breeze, from the roof.</p>

<p>The woman came out to say that Maldonado would
follow in “<i>un momento</i>.” To Rickard she looked like
the dried vine quivering from the wind. She asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
señors would they sit? The house was not fit; she was
cleaning.</p>

<p>Maldonado, his face creased from his nap, came out,
but not in “<i>un momento</i>.” He had been busy—“some
wretched fellows!” Rickard knew the man was lying.
He had been asleep. The woman had interrupted his
siesta. His eyes were almost lost; he blinked; he said
it was the sun. The day was so hot. <i>Dios mio</i>, why
did she stand there and not take pity on the señors, dying
of thirst as they must be. A glass of water. It was his
shame that he might not offer them wine—but he was a
poor man—with wife and children. His eyes shifted
from Rickard to MacLean.</p>

<p>The woman quivered away from the group. She disappeared
in the house.</p>

<p>“Glasses,” called Maldonado after her.</p>

<p>Her “<i>Si</i>” sounded like a hiss.</p>

<p>Rickard told his errand. Maldonado sputtered and
swore. By the mother of Mary the Virgin, that thing
would be stopped. It would be looked into, the rascal
would be caught. He pulled back his cotton coat, mussed
with sleep as was his face. He showed to the señors,
with pride, his badge. He was a rurale; he was there to
uphold the law. If the señors would but follow him,
they would see that he did not sleep at his post. He had
caught some of those drunken Indians on the road. He
had brought them here.</p>

<p>They followed him around the house, through the
wrecked garden. Maldonado shrugged at the stumps as
they passed, ruins that had once been roses. MacLean
felt his mouth pucker with repulsion as he watched the
figure in striped cotton, the eyes lost in their sleepy folds
of flesh, the cruel evil mouth. He was drawing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the pocket of his cotton pantaloons a bunch of iron keys,
tied with a dirty string. They were approaching a shed,
a cattle shed, it appeared to the guests. Maldonado unlocked
a gate of bars.</p>

<p>“Would the señors look in there?”</p>

<p>On a bed of old straw, three inert figures sprawled;
theirs complete oblivion.</p>

<p>Maldonado, kicked one of the figures with his feet.
“Drunken swine.” He locked the door with majesty.
He had proved his services, his ruraleship.</p>

<p>“But where do they get it?” demanded Rickard, turning
back into the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” the man evaded, “there is an ‘oasis’ somewhere.
Perhaps, the señor remembers, I told him before,
back in the sand-hills, ‘somewhere.’”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you find it?”</p>

<p>Maldonado was going to find it, surely! The señor
must have patience. His hands were so full. He remembered
the bunch of iron keys that he dropped in his
pocket. Every action of the man was surreptitious,
Rickard was noting. Maldonado would stand watching!
“I’m doing my duty, señor.”</p>

<p>“If you are so busy, Señor Maldonado,” suggested
Rickard, “I can help you. I’ll send down a few men to
help search. How many would you like?”</p>

<p>He expected a minute’s hesitation, but there was none.
Oh, it was not necessary. Later, maybe, he would call
on señor but it chanced that next week, or the next, a
squad of rurales was to be there for that very purpose
sent for by Maldonado. Oh, he was awake to his duty!
The señor would be satisfied. There would be no more
drunken Indians.</p>

<p>“Slick,” thought Rickard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>The woman was waiting by the oleander with glasses.
She filled them from an olla hanging in the shade of the
tree. It was cold as if iced.</p>

<p>Rickard saw her shrink every time she had to pass Maldonado.
Obviously, the fellow was a brute. She was
aware of his displeasure. She winced at a word from
him.</p>

<p>Both men were glad to go. Rickard left a piece of
silver in the woman’s hand. He hoped Maldonado had
not observed him.</p>

<p>They were riding away when a cry broke the stillness
of the air. “Hark, what was that?” MacLean turned a
shocked face toward Rickard. “A woman?”</p>

<p>It was anguished, strangled almost at birth. The men
waited, but there was silence in the patio.</p>

<p>“He got that money all right,” speculated Rickard.</p>

<p>“Struck her!”</p>

<p>“Or kicked her. That fellow is a brute.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going back?”</p>

<p>“Going back? What would we get for our pains?
Make it all the worse for the woman. You noticed he
called her his <i>wife</i>? The rurales are not supposed to
marry. It’s their unwritten law. But if she is, do you
know what that means? She’s his goods, his chattel;
his horse, his ox, his anything. You’re not in the states.
We can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>There is perhaps no more absorbing topic than “wife”
to the man who has not yet acquired one. Rickard and
MacLean let an unrecorded silence fall between them.
The word had sent them both traveling down secret
trails. MacLean was thinking of the girl he intended to
marry, when he was grown, of a girl with yellow eyes;
Rickard of a mistake he had once nearly made. His wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
if ever he had one, must be steadier than that; she must
not carry her sex like a gay flag to the breeze. His instinct
of flight, distaste had justified itself at camp. She
was a light little woman. He was beginning to feel a little
sorry for Hardin!</p>

<p>“I’ll race you into camp, MacLean!”</p>

<p>Their horses, released, sprang toward the Heading.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>A WHITE WOMAN AND A BROWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a few weeks, Mrs. Hardin found the mess-tent
diverting. Before the <i>Delta</i> had expanded the capacity
of the camp, her soft nook had been overtaxed,
her hospitality strained. The men of the Reclamation
Service, thrown into temporary inactivity, were eager to
accept the opportunity created for another. Failing that
other, her zeal had flagged. Events were moving quickly
at the break; Rickard was absorbed. Mrs. Hardin told
herself that it was the heat she wished to escape; not
to her own ear did she whisper that she was following
Rickard, nor that the percolator and chafing-dish, her
shelves and toy kitchen were a wasted effort. As inevitably
as a diamond finds a setting, so did Gerty
Hardin. She would return to it later, gathering luster
from its suggestion of womanliness. Sometime, the
pretty play would be resumed. All this subconsciously,
for she hung a veil between her processes. She kept on
good terms with herself by ignoring self-confidences.
She would have called morbidness the self-analysis of
those who dig deep into their psychology for roots of
motives, who question each trailing vine.</p>

<p>Rickard, the discovery unfolded slowly, took his meals
irregularly. His breakfast was gulped down before the
women appeared; his dinners where he found them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“No wonder!” reflected Gerty Hardin. “Ling’s cooking
is so bad.” Discontentedly, she pictured Rickard as
finding solace in the Hamlin kitchen; reveling in Mrs.
Silent’s chickens and eggs. The camp butter was shocking.
She found Ling’s large quantities unpalatable.</p>

<p>There came a butterless epoch; a horrid gap. Ling
did not <i>manage</i> right. Butterless toast and broiled
chicory! Small wonder the manager foraged for his
meals. Somehow, the thought of Rickard living as did
Hardin in times of stress, as the bird of the air, did
not occur to the woman who thought of Rickard as different,
a gentleman who required luxury. She had
created a man from her own imaginings; she was evolving
a woman to meet the approbation of her creation.</p>

<p>A dinner of pale oily beans, followed by a dessert
of prunes swimming in a pallid sirup, gave her a morning
of reflection. The Hamlin kitchen was giving her
uneasiness. Her own abilities, unoccupied, were ironic.
She worked out a mission as she lay across her bed that
hot afternoon.</p>

<p>“To justify my being here.” A phrase of Innes recurred
to her; it became now her own.</p>

<p>Her duty became so clear that she could no longer
lie still. Immediately, she must retrieve her weeks of
idleness; what must Rickard think of her? In spite of
the scorching space that lay between her tent and the
ramada, of the sun beating down like burning hail on the
glittering sand, she must dress and seek out Rickard.</p>

<p>She buttoned herself thoughtfully into a frock of pale-colored
muslin, cream slipping toward canary. White
was too glaring on a red-hot day like this. Pink was too
hot, blue too definite. Pity the lavender dress was still
a fabric of dreams! A parasol of pastel green, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
looked like a sprig of fragrant mignonette. The exertion
of dressing brought the perspiration to her face.
It had to be carefully dusted with powder. Strange,
how she used to think the summers of the desert insupportable.
After a torrid season of New York in her
toy apartment, that humid sticky heat, that shut-oven
of smells, this was to be borne. Already, the desert
was improving; for she herself had not changed, of
course.</p>

<p>It was the ice! She decided that any place could be
endured once ice is procurable. Even bad butter is disguised
when frozen into bricks. Her thoughts rounded
the circle, brought her back to her grievances. Ling
certainly needed help.</p>

<p>She found the open space of the trapezium swarming
with strange dark faces. So silent their coming, she
had not heard the arrival of the tribes. Over by Ling’s
coveted mesquits gathered an increasing group of bucks
with their pinto ponies which had carried them across a
country of glaring distances. She isolated the Cocopahs,
stately as bronze statues, their long hair streaming, or
wound, mud-caked under brilliant head-cloths. Foregathering
with them were men of other tribes; these
must be the Yumas and Deguinos, the men needed on
the river. Tom had told her that the long-haired tribes
were famous for their water-craft. These were the men
who were to work on the rafts, weave the great mattresses.
A squad of short-haired Pimas with their squaws
and babies and their gaudy bundles, gaped at the fair-haired
woman as she passed. They were dazed and dizzy
from their first long railroad ride. The central space was
filling up with Pimas and Maricopas, Papagoes, too;
she knew them collectively by their short hair. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
were the brush-cutters to replace the stampeding peons.
This, then, meant the beginning of real activity. Tom
would at last be satisfied. He would no longer sulk and
rage alternately at the hold-up of the work.</p>

<p>It began to look dramatic to her. She picked her way
through the stolid groups, the children and squaws staring
at her finery, at the queer color of her hair. The
value of the enterprise pricked at her consciousness.
And she was going to help it; in her own way, but that
was the womanly way! She wished that she had thought
of it before.</p>

<p>Her bright darting glance discovered MacLean under
one of Ling’s mesquits. He was poring over some of
his own hieroglyphs in his stenographic pad. One of
her bright detached smiles reached him. He followed
her direction, his mouth puckering.</p>

<p>Before she reached the ramada, she saw that another
woman was there. She caught an impassioned gesture.
Her only surmise rested on Innes. The visitor, following
Rickard’s eyes, turned. Gerty saw that she was dark;
she looked the half-breed. The brown woman drew back
as the white woman entered. Gerty smiled an airy reassurance.
She herself would wait. She did not want to
be hurried. She told Rickard that she had plenty of time.</p>

<p>“There is something you want to tell me?” Rickard’s
patience was courteous but firm. He would hear her
errand first. Gerty, remembering MacLean’s banishment
to the mesquits, the imploring attitude of the
stranger, determined that she would not be sent away.</p>

<p>“Will you excuse me, señora? It will be only a minute.”</p>

<p>She was to tell her errand, and briefly! Gerty swept
past the intruder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Sit down, Mrs. Hardin?”</p>

<p>Resenting the inflection, she said she would stand. Her
voice was a little hard, her eyes were veiled, as she told
her mission. Her usual fluency dragged; she felt a lack
of sympathy. She saw Rickard look twice toward the
Mexican; she knew she was not holding his attention.</p>

<p>Biting her lip, she acknowledged that Ling was doing
the best he could, at least the best he knew how, but of
course, he had his limitations. He needed an assistant;
his hands were over-full. She remembered the phrase
in time to hurl it to its place; she wanted to justify her
presence in camp. In short, she proposed a commissary
department, herself in charge.</p>

<p>Rickard had a weak moment. Outside, the place was
teeming with Indians to be enrolled and placed in camp.
Forestier, the Indian Outing Agent, who had come in
on the train with three of the tribes, was waiting in the
neighboring tent. Rickard wanted some new work
begun to-morrow; there were but a few hours left of
this day. There were letters, despatches to be got off.</p>

<p>“I’d like to feel I was of some use,” urged Gerty again,
this time prettily, taking him back into her friendship
again. “My heart is bound up in this undertaking; if
I’m allowed to stay, I’d like to help along. This is the
only way I can, the woman’s way.” It was a proud
humility. Did not Rickard think that the best way, the
only way? She knew he would think so, indeed!</p>

<p>“Aren’t you taking a good deal on yourself, Mrs.
Hardin?”</p>

<p>Then she forgave his hesitation quite, as it was of
her he was thinking. “Not if it <i>helps</i>.” Her voice was
low and soft, as if this were a secret between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“It’s not so easy as you think.” He could see Forestier
leave his tent, glance toward the ramada. Then
he saw him join MacLean by the mesquits. This was
no time to argue a petty question. It would do no harm
to try. “Why, of course, anything you want, Mrs.
Hardin.” And, remembering her former position, he
added: “The camp’s yours as much as mine.”</p>

<p>A glad smile rewarded him. She went out, reluctantly.
She knew the ways of those half-breeds! She could
understand a little Spanish, so she made her step drag.
The silence behind her was disquieting. The brown
woman with the wreck of beauty in her tragic eyes was
staring after her; she did not see Rickard’s gesture.</p>

<p>There was a new significance in MacLean’s absence
from the ramada. What could that woman have to say
that MacLean must not hear? She did not see the
mewling babes, half naked, who gaped at her as she
passed the squaws. The stolid groups parted for her,
and she moved through, oblivious to their color and
charm, to the historic import of it all. For the first time,
the weak tenure on her old lover came to her. Not a
sign had he yet given of their understanding, of the
piquant situation. Themselves, old sweethearts, thrown
together in this wilderness. What had she built her
hopes on? A word here, a translated phrase, or magnified
glance. She would not harbor the new worry.
Why, it would be all right. She used Tom’s phrase, the
one she hated, in solemn unconsciousness. Life had
evidently planned that from the first. Fate insisted on
repairing her mad mistake.</p>

<p>At her tent, letters were waiting to be written; letters
to her grocer in Los Angeles, one to Coulter, in Calexico.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
She was going to begin her régime by serving good
butter—iced butter. No more oily horror melting on a
warm plate. She remembered a new brand of olives
put up in tins; Rickard, she remembered, loved ripe
olives. She would show them all what a woman with
executive ability could do.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>BETRAYAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“SIT down, señora. Don’t be frightened. We won’t
let him hurt you.” Rickard vulgarized his Castilian
to the reach of her rude dialect.</p>

<p>Her work-sharpened fingers moved restlessly under
her reboso. She pulled it together as though the day
were not scorching. Her eyes questioned his sympathy.
A flash of desperate courage had left her weak and
tremulous. She stood by the long pine table looking
hopelessly down on the señor whose eyes had twice
looked kindly at her.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he repeated, and motioned to a chair.</p>

<p>For long years her misery had been silent; her tongue
could not tell her story. She shook her head. “Take
your time, take your time,” counseled the manager. He
feared a burst of hysteria.</p>

<p>There was a sound of feet outside the ramada. The
Indians, passing and repassing, brought a gleam of anger
to her eyes. She recalled her wrongs; they lashed her
into fury. Familiar as was Rickard with the peons’
speech in their own country, he could not keep up with
her history. Lurid words ran past his ears. Out of the
jumble of abuse, of shame and misery, he caught a new
note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“You say Maldonado, <i>himself</i>, sells liquor to the Indians?”</p>

<p>“Ssh, señor!” Some one might hear him! She looked
over a terrified shoulder. Maldonado had told her he
would kill her if she ever told—it came to her, as a
shock, what she was doing, what she had done. It
meant ruin for them all—for the muchachos. That had
slipped out, the selling of the liquor. She could have
told her story without that; she wanted to deny it. Relentlessly
Rickard made her repeat it, acknowledge the
truth.</p>

<p>“Ssh, señor, it has been so for many years, since I
went there, oh, years ago. No one knows, who would
suspect a rurale, a rurale who does his duty? He would
kill me—”</p>

<p>“Stop shaking. No one is listening.” Rickard forced
a tone of brutality. The poor wretch, he suspected, had
been trained by the whip; he threatened to send for
Maldonado.</p>

<p>“No, I will tell you, will tell you everything, señor.
It is an easy trick, señor. No one would take the word
of an Indian against Maldonado, a rurale. And the
drink makes the men crazy, or stupid. Afterward, he
does not remember where he got the tequila. Maldonado
whips him, the Indian does not know it is the same hand,
and when he is turned loose, he would kiss his feet— Or
perhaps, Maldonado sends him to Ensenada—who believes
him when he swears the rurale who arrested him
made him drunk, señor? Twice, three times, Maldonado’s
life was in danger—but the law made quick work
of an Indian who tried to kill a rurale. He would kill
me, señor—would Maldonado.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” drove Rickard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Her bony fingers worked restlessly. She was shaking
with terror.</p>

<p>“Is it known that he keeps liquors there?” Rickard
saw he would have to help her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, señor. Not even the Indians. They come,
by accident. If they have no money, they are sent on.
If they have—” Her curving, black-shrouded shoulders
shrugged. “The walls are thick. They leave their
money and their wits behind them. Sometimes, they
wake a mile down the river, under the willows. They
have come back to tell their wrongs to their friend, Maldonado,
who promises to help them, to find the thief
who has wrung those cotton pockets. It would make
you laugh, señor, but if he finds it out, he will kill me.”</p>

<p>“What makes you tell me, now?” Rickard hunted for
the ulcer. He knew there was a personal wrong. “What
has Maldonado been doing to you? Has he left you?”</p>

<p>The veil of fear was torn from her eyes. The trembling
woman was gone, a vengeful wildcat in her place.
“Left me, Maldonado? Left his home, where he traps
the Indian with one coin in his pockets? No, señor.
He brought her to our home, <i>there</i>, Lupe, the wife of
Felipe, the Deguino. Felipe had found a wife in Nogales,
had brought her down to the river, a mile below
the oleander. She found the desert dull; she had the
city’s foolishness in her head. Felipe was gone a good
deal. Maldonado sent him to Ensenada with some poor
wretches. Maldonado was never at home then; I told
him not to fool with Felipe; the Indian was dangerous;
he had hot blood. Maldonado struck me—he kicked me—he
said I was jealous—and hit me again.” Rickard saw
jealousy in the unveiled eyes of hate. She pressed her
hand to her breast. Her movement betrayed pain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
whether a bruise, or a deeper hurt to the heart of her
he could not guess.</p>

<p>She told the climax simply, her hand pressed over her
bosom. “Maldonado told me to get a big meal—<i>tortillas</i>
and <i>enchilades</i>, metates: I told him that it was for
Felipe; I could see a black plot in his eyes. He laughed
at me; when I said I would not cook for that treachery,
he cursed me, he kicked me again.” She threw off the
reboso, dragging her dress loose. “Don’t,” frowned
Rickard. He had seen a welt across her shoulder—a
screaming line of pain.</p>

<p>She wound the reboso around the dishonored shoulder.
“I cooked his tortillas, his dinner! There was a big
meal. There was a lot of liquor—Felipe was drunk; the
tequila made him mad, quite mad. He seemed to know
something was wrong; he fought as Maldonado dragged
him to the cell, the señor remembers the cell? The next
day, Maldonado sent for two rurales, Felipe drank the
pitchers of wine he put through the bars, but there was
no liquor in sight when the rurales came! They started
the next day for Ensenada, taking Felipe; that day,
Maldonado brought Lupe home. I said she could not
stay and he laughed in my face, señor. He put me outside
the walls. He thought I would beg to be let in the
next morning, come sneaking in like a dog that has been
beaten, wash the faces of the muchachos, grind the corn
for the metates, but I could stand it no longer. I beat
that gate until my fingers bled. I remembered the kind
face of the señor, and then I came here. You will help
me, señor?”</p>

<p>“What is it you want me to do?” But he knew what
she wanted him to do!</p>

<p>“Send that woman away. Make him send Lupe away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Let me stay here until he is over his anger. He is not
bad, Maldonado, when he is not angry. Make him set
Felipe free; <i>he</i> will keep that Lupe from my house, from
the children.”</p>

<p>Rickard shook his head. “I shall have to look into
this thing. If this is true, it’s prison for your husband.
You won’t have to fear Lupe.”</p>

<p>“Prison, señor? For Maldonado? You will never get
him. He will swear it is not so. He will kill me; he
will know that I have told. They will not believe my
word against his.”</p>

<p>She was verging toward a spasm of terror. To quiet
her, Rickard said that they would have other proof. And
her husband would have no more power to hurt her;
Maldonado’s crimes would protect her from him.</p>

<p>He could see the struggle in her soul; he knew she
wanted to say she had been lying to him. It was not that
sort of revenge she wanted; she wanted her husband.
She wanted him to help her get her husband back. The
revenge sought to trap Lupe—</p>

<p>“When he gets out, he will kill me, señor.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that will be a long time, señora! And you
will have protection. You will get a divorce— He is
your husband, señora? You are married to him?”</p>

<p>She screamed at him. MacLean looked up from his
note-book. “A divorce?” She was approaching hysteria.
“<i>Si</i>, señor, he is my husband. We were married
in a church. Never would I get a divorce from my
husband. No, not Lucrezia Maldonado.”</p>

<p>Rickard back-stepped, to calm her. It would be all
right, anyway. She would be protected. He would see
that Maldonado did not harm her. He would look out
for her and the children, and she might stay here, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
camp, until the thing was settled. In the meantime, she
must rest—</p>

<p>He wanted to get rid of her. Maldonado and his villainy
must wait. The Indians were waiting to be registered.
They were to be sent to their camp, tribe by
tribe. Forestier was waiting for him. MacLean was
waiting—</p>

<p>“You will let me work for you, señor?”</p>

<p>“There’s always work. I won’t have to send my washing
to Yuma, and I haven’t had a button sewed on for
months—nor has MacLean, nor Jenks—you can darn
their socks, and help Ling with the beds; we can keep
you busy, señora. And you can go back to the children
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>The terror was seizing her again. Before she could
begin her pleading, he called to MacLean.</p>

<p>“Ask Ling to find a tent for Señora Maldonado. Tell
him to give her a good meal.”</p>

<p>Her eyes appealed to Rickard over her shoulder. Her
body wavered with fatigue. Her eyes were cavernous,
with dark radiating shadows.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?”</p>

<p>“I walked, señor.”</p>

<p>“Walked! You must be dead. Get to bed. You’ll be
all right in the morning.” A twenty-mile walk to escape
the cruelty of the brute whom she would not divorce because
of a few priest-mumbled words! Not hers the
sacrament of love, of vows mutually kept, yet he knew
that he could not depend on her testimony to convict
that scoundrel down the river. One glance from his
eye, and she would be a shivering lump of fear again.</p>

<p>He must trap the rogue. Some Indian, that was the
plan. He would ask Coronel. Coronel, himself, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
not play the game; Maldonado would not sell liquor to
the white man’s friend. He was too wily for that. But
some buck—Coronel would make the choice. An Indian
who would go to the adobe, pretend intoxication; be
clear-headed enough to betray him. That infernal place
must be closed. The woman had come in the nick of
time. Those tribes were to be guarded as restless children—</p>

<p>He went out to meet Forestier.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>RICKARD MAKES A NEW ENEMY AND A NEW FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE coming of the Indians gave the impetus the
work had lacked. Under Jenks, of the railroad
company, a large force was put on the river; these, the
weavers of the brush mattresses that were to line the
river-bed. On the banks were the brush-cutters; tons of
willows were to be cut to weave into the forty miles of
woven wire cable waiting for the cross-strands. Day
by day, the piles of willow branches grew higher, the
brush-cutters working ahead of the mattress workers in
the stream. In the dense undergrowth, the stolid Indians,
Pimas and Maricopas and Papagoes, struggled
with the fierce thorn of the mesquit and the over-powering
smell of the arrow-weed. As tough as the hickory
handles they wielded, they fought a clearing through
dense thickets, in the intense tropic heat.</p>

<p>It was a glittering day. A copper sun rode the sky;
the desert sand burned through the shoe leather. Down-stream,
the Brobdingnagian arm of the dredge fell into
the mud of the by-pass, dropping its slimy burden on
the far bank. Twenty-four hours of sun, and the mud
bank would resemble a pile of rocks that wind and sun
again would disintegrate into a silt. Down the long
stretch of levee, the “skinners” drove their mules and
scrapers; two pile-drivers were setting in the treacherous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
stream the piles which were to anchor the steel-cabled
mattresses to the river-bed. It was a well-organized,
active scene. Rickard, in his office, dictating letters and
telegrams to MacLean, Jr., felt his first satisfaction.
Things were beginning to show the result of months of
planning. Cars were rushing in from north and east;
every quarry between Los Angeles and Tucson requisitioned
for their undertaking.</p>

<p>A shadow fell on the pine desk. Ling, in blue ticking
shirt and white butcher apron, waited for the “boss” to
look up. He stood wiping the perspiration from his
head, hairless except for the long silk-tapered queue.</p>

<p>“Well, Ling?”</p>

<p>“I go tamale.” His voice was soft as silk. “I no
stay.”</p>

<p>It was a thunderclap. There was no one to replace
Ling, who was drawing down the salary of a private
secretary.</p>

<p>“You sick?” demanded Rickard. Lose Ling? It
would be more demoralizing to the camp than to lose an
engineer.</p>

<p>“Ling no sick.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you want more money?”</p>

<p>“Plenty get money.” The yellow lean fingers spread
wide apart. “Money all lite. Bossee all lite. No likee
woman. Woman she stay, Ling go.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hardin!” Rickard woke up.</p>

<p>“She all time makee trouble. She talkee butter—butter,
butter. All time. She clazy. She think woman
vellee fine cook. She show Ling cookee plunes. Teachee
Ling cookee plunes! I no stay that woman.” Unutterable
finality in the leathern face. Rickard and MacLean,
Jr., exchanged glances which deepened from concern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
into perplexity. They could not afford to lose Ling.
And offend Mrs. Hardin, the camp already Hardinesque?</p>

<p>Rickard grew placating. “Now, see here, Ling, you
no understand. Mrs. Hardin a nice lady; nice home,
she like things first-class. You understand things first-class?”</p>

<p>Sourly, Ling vouchsafed that he, too, understood
things first-class. “She say bad plunes. Too much
water. She bossee me all time. Mr. Lickard likee lady,
keep lady, no keep Ling.”</p>

<p>Rickard looked at his watch. He wanted to be off.
He had been promising himself an afternoon for three
weeks, since the day the tribes came in. He must start
things moving at Maldonado’s. Coronel, who had come
in from Yuma yesterday, had told him of an Indian who
would do the trick for him, who could withstand liquor,
and pretend to reel with it. Already, he had lost some
of his Indians. They might wander back; the chances
were good that they had been “sent up.” He needed
every Indian. But more he needed Ling. He spent
another half-hour in wheedling. They met at the starting
place. “Ling go tamale.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lord,” groaned the manager, capitulating. “All
right, Ling. I’ll speak to Mrs. Hardin to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Even that would not do. The two men made out that
Mrs. Hardin was to invade his quarters that evening and
teach the outraged Chinese how to cook prunes. That
insult had caused the rebellion. “She come, I go.” It
was a statement, not a threat. Rickard succumbed.</p>

<p>“All right, Ling. I’ll stop it.” With the dignity of
an oriental prince, Ling pattered out of the tent. Rickard
was puckering his lips at his secretary. “I’d rather
take castor oil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Take time!” laughed MacLean, Jr.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” Rickard’s reply was rueful. “I
can’t take chances with Ling. More Hardin trouble, or
my name’s not Casey. We’ll quit for to-day, Junior. If
I’m to head her off, I’ll have to be moving some.”</p>

<p>A half-hour later, MacLean saw his chief leave his
tent. He was in fresh linens; and MacLean noticed
that he had a pin in his tie.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t swap places with him this minute! She’ll
be as mad as a wet hen!”</p>

<p>Heartily, Rickard, too, was disliking his errand. But
there was no shirking it. Ling must be appeased. “And,
already, they have enough reason to dislike me. And
here comes this to make matters worse!</p>

<p>“It’s not their fault, it’s Hardin who’s inflaming them
with his wrongs. Lord, what does the man want? Here
was his precious scheme going to pot for lack of funds,
and bad management, and he goes whining to Marshall
for help, and now he’s sore because he got what he asked.
He wants to be the high-muck-a-muck; he pretends it’s
the valley salvation. If it were that, he’d be whistling,
instead of kicking.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin, from her bed by her screen window, saw
him coming. She slipped into a semi-negligee of alternate
rows of lace and swiss constructed for such possible
emergencies. She did not make the mistake of
smoothing her hair; her instinct told her that the fluffy
disorder bore out the use of the negligee. She was
sewing, in her ramada, when Rickard’s knock sounded
on the screen door.</p>

<p>Despite his protests, she started water boiling in her
chafing-dish. He had not time for tea, he declared, but
she insisted on making this call of a social nature. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
opened a box of sugar wafers, her zeal that of a child
with a toy kitchen; she was playing doll’s house.</p>

<p>Rickard made several openings for his errand, but her
wits sped like a gopher from his labored digging. He
suggested that she was working too hard.</p>

<p>“Oh, I love it,” she declared. “It justifies my being
here. I know you must think women a nuisance here
at camp, Mr. Rickard. I like to do my little best. And
Ling needed help. We get along pretty well. He is
crude, of course. What could you expect? I’ve taken
the liberty of sending out for some extra things. And
that reminds me, has my bundle been heard from? Isn’t
that the most mysterious thing? It left Chicago, why, it
must be months ago.”</p>

<p>Rickard said that the missing bundle had been last
heard from in Tepic; by some stupid mistake, it had got
into the hands of the Mexican officials, “who were playing
ball with it!”</p>

<p>“The mistake came in having it sent here; this is
Mexico; everything gets balled up the instant it crosses
the line. If you’d had it sent to Yuma now—but you
were speaking of orders, camp orders—”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to trouble you with that,” cried Gerty,
filling up his cup with an aromatic blend of tea she had
sent for to Los Angeles. So far, it had been wasted on
the men of the Service, boys, most of them. She felt
more at home with Rickard than ever before. The quizzical,
amused glance of appraisement was gone, replaced
by an earnestness she misread. She met his mood with
womanly dignity; she tutored her coquetries, withheld
her archness. She remembered a day when her flirtations
had deflected her whole life; she no longer said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
“ruined.” One battle lost? “Time to fight another!”
She placed a wafer or two on his protesting plate.</p>

<p>He brought up Ling’s contrariness, and he found they
were discussing the Indians. There were a hundred
questions she wanted to ask about them. Was it true
the popular impression that they caked their heads with
mud to—clean their hair? It was true? How dreadful!
She liked to believe that it was some religious custom,
a penance of some kind.</p>

<p>Rickard saw another opening. He related his plan of
having the camp on the Arizona side of the river to save
duties on food stuffs; they ate, the Indians, in Arizona,
and slept in old Mexico: “It saves the O. P. a nice little
sum every month. It’s not an easy thing to manage a
commissary, as you know—”</p>

<p>The new hole was dug, but the gopher was out of sight.
She spoke of a new book the critics were praising.</p>

<p>He found he would have to discard diplomacy, blurt
out his message; use bludgeons for this scampering
agility.</p>

<p>He put down his cup; no, he would not have any more.
“Thank you just the same. It is really delicious. I feel
like a truant, sipping tea here. I’m forgetting my errand.”
He stood. She had never seen him hampered by
embarrassment before. Her smile was gently encouraging,
womanly sweet. She really admired him, more than
any one she had ever known. His reserve called to her
always, to reach his ideals, ideals she could only guess
at. Her mind grasped at the concrete; she believed him
impatient of external coarseness. She was always conscious
of her dress, her surroundings, her table when he
was present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“My mission is a little awkward, Mrs. Hardin. I hope
you will take it all right, that you will not be offended.”</p>

<p>“Offended?” Her face showed alarm.</p>

<p>“It’s about Ling. He’s a queer fellow, they all are,
you know.” He was blundering like a schoolboy under
the growing shadow in Gerty’s blue eyes. “They resent
authority, that is, from women. He is a tyrant, Ling is.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right, Mr. Rickard. He is an unruly
servant. But you could replace him easily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we couldn’t. It’s no easy matter to get a
cook while it’s hot like this; and a camp cook, who can
cook quantities, and yet make them palatable—”</p>

<p>Then what was it he was trying to say? The blue
eyes met his at last squarely, a glint of warning in them
he would not see.</p>

<p>“I have to give in to him, we all do; have to humor
him. We’ve spoiled him, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Ah, she would not help him. Let him
flounder!</p>

<p>“He wants to be let alone; he doesn’t appreciate your
kind help, Mrs. Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Her eyes were hot with tears; angry tears.
She would not for the wealth of that desert let him see
her cry. This was so different from what she had expected.
This was what he had come to say. She could
not speak, nor would not. She sat in her spoiled doll’s
house, all her pleasure in her toy dishes, her pretty finery,
ruined. She would no longer meet his eyes; mocking,
forever, let them be! She had been so proud of her
managing, and here he listens to the complaints of a
Chinese cook! Complaints against her, against Gerty
Holmes, the girl he had once loved! He could not care
if he could humiliate her so. She stared at her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
lying limp over the hand-whipped negligee. The azure
hue of the silk slip beneath had lost its charm to her.
It was the most vivid moment of her life. Not even
when Rickard had left her, with his kisses still warm
on her lips, had she felt so outraged. He was treating
her as though she were a servant—discharging her—because
she was the wife of Hardin. Her eyes grew
black with anger; she hated them both; between them,
their jealousy, their rivalry, what had they made of her
life? She suddenly realized that she was old. If she
were young, he would not flout her like this. She remembered
the woman she had seen in his ramada; she
had heard that the Mexican was in camp, employed by
Rickard. Her thoughts were like swarming hornets.</p>

<p>“He’s an ungrateful beast, Mrs. Hardin, if he doesn’t
appreciate your labors. I’d let him struggle alone. As
I say, we’ve spoiled him.”</p>

<p>“He has been complaining?” It was all she could say
with control.</p>

<p>“He’s a tyrant. I told him I would not let you waste
your kindness one instant longer—”</p>

<p>Oh, she understood! A bitter pleasure to see him so
confused. Rickard, before whose superior appraisement
she had so often wilted! She would not help him out,
never! She rose when he paused. He thanked her for
meeting him half-way, and her smile was inscrutable.</p>

<p>“So I’m discharged?”</p>

<p>He misunderstood her dignity, as before he had misconstrued
her flirtations.</p>

<p>Gerty drooped under the sudden coming of age. She
knew she must be old.</p>

<p>“Or he would not treat me so! he would not treat me
so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“You can’t be discharged, if you’ve never been employed,
can you? Thank you once again, and for your
tea. It was delicious. I wish Ling would give us tea
like that.”</p>

<p>Boorish, all of it, and blundering! Why wouldn’t he
go? When he had hurt her so! had hurt her so!</p>

<p>Her hand met his, but not her eyes. If he did not go
quickly, something would happen; he would see her crying.
The angels that guard blunderers got Rickard out
of the tent without a suspicion of threatening tears.
She threw off her negligee and the pale blue slip; the
tears must wait for that. Then she flung herself on her
bed, and shook it with the grief of wounded vanity.</p>

<p>MacLean looked up as Rickard reentered the office.</p>

<p>“It went all right,” nodded his chief, cheerful now
that was out of the way. “She didn’t mind. Tired of it
already, I guess.”</p>

<p>MacLean looked at him thoughtfully. Funny for as
keen a man as Rickard to be a dolt about women. No
woman would forgive that; Gerty’s kind of women.
Mind! Mind being turned down? He’d find out later
what she thought about it. That was his blind side.
And she’d been throwing herself at him ever since she
came to the Heading. Everybody had seen it—hold on,
everybody did not include Rickard, himself. MacLean,
Jr., softly whistled.</p>

<p>That evening, the chief had a visitor. The wife of
Maldonado, some of the fear pressed out of her eyes,
brought in his laundered khakis, socks, darned and
matched; all the missing buttons replaced.</p>

<p>“I haven’t worn a matched sock,” he told her, “for
months. That’s great, señora.”</p>

<p>He wanted to get to bed, but she lingered. She wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
to talk to him about her troubles; he had cautioned her
against talking about them in camp, so she overflowed to
him whenever she found a chance; about Maldonado,
the children; Lupe. It was getting wearying; but he
could not shove the poor thing out. She wanted him to
say again that Maldonado could not harm her. He reminded
her of the solution; she could leave him.</p>

<p>“And go to hell! Oh, no, never would I do that. It
would be a mortal sin.”</p>

<p>Rickard stretched. He had to be up early in the
morning.</p>

<p>“The señor has been very kind,” the woman’s gratitude
resembled a faithful dog’s.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was nothing.” His lids were drooping. At
five the next morning!</p>

<p>“The señor, he is lonely?”</p>

<p>“Lonely!” He laughed in her puzzled face. Great
Scott, he was dying for sleep! He did not catch her
drift.</p>

<p>“The señor, he is so kind, and he is lonely. He has
no one to sew for him, to mend his clothes, to keep his
tent. I am so grateful to the señor.”</p>

<p>Had she misunderstood his suggestions about a divorce?
Rickard sat up.</p>

<p>“You are doing very well for me. Thank you. And
now, good night, señora. I’m up early in the morning.”</p>

<p>There was something on her mind. She walked toward
the entrance of the tent-house, but turned back.</p>

<p>“I have a sister, señor, who would be good to you,
mend your clothes, when I am gone. The señor will be
lonely, then, is it not so? She is grown now, almost
fifteen. She is <i>muy sympatica</i>, can sew, and can cook—”</p>

<p>“Oh, lord—” cried Rickard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Her refrain was insistent. “The señor is lonely; you
need a <i>mujer</i>.”</p>

<p>“No <i>es posiblé</i>,” his answer was rough to her savage,
childish kindliness.</p>

<p>The señor was so kind, he would be kind to her
sister—</p>

<p>“<i>Por Dios</i>, no!” cried Rickard.</p>

<p>Señora Maldonado gave a sharp intake of breath, an
aborted scream. Rickard, too, saw a man’s figure outside
the screen door. The Mexican woman pressed a
frightened hand to her heart. Of course, it was the
vengeful Maldonado—he would kill her—</p>

<p>“If I am intruding,” it was the voice of Hardin.</p>

<p>“Come right in,” welcomed Rickard. “Get along,
señora.” The Maldonado slipped out into the night, her
hand still against her heart.</p>

<p>Hardin, a roll of maps under his arm, entered with
a rough sneer on his face. A dramatic scene, that, he
had interrupted! And Rickard who did not like to have
women in camp. White women!</p>

<p>Rickard, still sleepy, asked him to sit down.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no. I wanted to speak to you about those
concrete aprons. They tell me you’ve given an order
not to have them.”</p>

<p>“The order’s from Tucson.” Rickard yawned covertly.</p>

<p>“A child’s order!” exploded Hardin. “Why doesn’t
Marshall come and see for himself? Brush jetties! It
will never stand!”</p>

<p>“He is coming.” Rickard wrinkled the sleep out of his
eyes. “He will be here next week.”</p>

<p>“It’s a crime!” Hardin unfolded his map, spreading
it over the table. A bottle of ink was upset in his
eagerness. Rickard was thoroughly awake by the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
he had mopped the purple black flood with towels and
blotting-paper. Hardin recovered his map, but slightly
damaged. Two of Rickard’s books were ruined.</p>

<p>“See here,” cried Hardin, still excited. “Calculate
that distance. If this is a farce, Marshall ought to say
so.” He pulled a chair up to the ink-stained table.
“Brush aprons! He’s wasting our time, and the company’s
money.”</p>

<p>Rickard resigned himself to a long argument. It was
three o’clock when Hardin let him turn in.</p>

<p>When he was getting ready for bed, he remembered
the melodramatic scene Hardin had entered upon. He
stared comprehendingly at the screen door—seeing, with
understanding, Hardin’s coarse sneer—the Maldonado,
breathing fast, her hand over her heart. “Of course,
he’ll think—good lord, these people will make me into
an old woman! I don’t care what the whole caboodle
of them think!”</p>

<p>Five minutes after blowing out his candle, he was
deeply sleeping.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>SMUDGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM her tent, where she was writing a letter that
lagged somehow, Innes Hardin had seen Rickard
go to her sister’s tent. She did not need to analyze the
sickness of sight that watched the dancing step acknowledge
its intention. It meant wretchedness, for
<i>Tom</i>. At a time when he most needed gentleness and
sympathy, rasped as he was by his humiliations and disappointments—how
could any woman be so cruel? As
for Rickard, he was beneath contempt—if it were true,
Gerty’s story, told in shrugs and dashes. She had jilted
him for Tom; and this his revenge? Did it hang together,
if he still loved her? Loved Gerty? How was
it that those clear-sighted, quizzical eyes had not at
once penetrated her flimsy evasions, her deviousness?
Could he ever have cared, or was the story a web of
vanity? Still caring, what would be the end of it all?</p>

<p>She had not known that she had such feeling as the
thought roused in her. It proved what the blood tie is,
this tigerish passion sweeping through her, as her eyes
watched that closed tent—it was love for Tom, pity for
Tom. Sex honor, why, Gerty did not know the meaning
of the words! Were she not a harem woman, a cheap
little vain thing, she would not be flirting in a time like
this—getting on the track with her coquetries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>She pulled herself away from her wire-netting window,
and took up her pen. What had she been writing about?
“They are working steadily on the permanent concrete
gate, and pushing the wooden gate to control the autumn
floods—” How long would it be before Tom would see
what every one else was seeing? What would he do
when he knew? Hating Rickard already, bitter as he
was—</p>

<p>She was not so biased as he. She could see why
Marshall had had to reorganize, or Faraday, whoever it
was who had done it. Estrada had shown her; and
MacLean. Her sense of justice had done the rest. Rickard
had proved his efficiency; the levee, the camp, the
military discipline all showed the general. Whether he
were anything of an engineer, time would tell that. MacLean
thought so, and Eduardo, but the others did not,
the older engineers, hot-headed for Tom. It was a long
call he was making!</p>

<p>Where had she left off? “The wooden gate—” her
letter as wooden! And how could she vitalize it without
telling the personal history which was animating the
endeavor into drama? Her brother, Mr. Marshall, the
new manager— Suppose Tom were to come back? She
must watch for him—make some excuse to pull him in
if he should come back before that other went— Hateful,
such eavesdropping! A prisoner to that man’s
gallivanting!</p>

<p>For an instant she did not recognize the figure outside
Gerty’s tent. Her fears saw Tom. She reached the
screen door in time to see Rickard lift his hat to a disappearing
flurry of ruffles.</p>

<p>She had seen the ruffles, but she could not see the distress
behind that swiftly shut door. Angry eyes watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
Rickard’s step swing him toward Ling’s mesquits. She
was still standing, her brown hands tightly laced, when
he emerged, and swung toward his ramada.</p>

<p>How much later was it that he came out again into
that wash of sunlight, followed by MacLean, who had
his absorbed look on that was almost adoration? How
long had she been standing there? After they had gone,
she would take a walk. The letter could wait till the
morning.</p>

<p>From the levee that day, she had a glimpse of the
Mexican woman on her knees by the river, rubbing
clothes against a smooth stone. A pile of tight-wrung
socks lay on the bank. Innes stood and watched her.</p>

<p>“I must remember to speak of her to Gerty,” she determined.
“She probably does not know that there is a
washerwoman in camp.”</p>

<p>Then she speedily forgot about it; forgot even her
anger of the afternoon. The skinners driving their
mules over the hot sands, the mattress weavers twisting
willows through the steel cables, the pile-drivers pinning
down the gigantic carpet as it was woven to the treacherous
bed of that river, the Indians cutting arrow-weed,
that dredge-arm swinging low—the diversified panorama
caught her as it always did.</p>

<p>It was so big, the man-work! Behind the big fight
lay its purpose. Not only to save the homes of that far-reaching
valley, but to make room for the homes of the
future. Always a thrill in that, the work for those yet
unborn!</p>

<p>Still sleeping that land was, land that would feed a
nation. Stretching north to the strange new sea, that
made this one with the age of fable, reaching over into
Mexico, its lateral boundaries the distant unreal mountains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
here was a magic soil that piratical rains had not
filched of its wonders. Here tired out men, from their
tired out farms, would find homes, here the sick would
find healing in its breath, safety and succor in its spaces—that
dredge-arm swinging across the channel would
make all that come true!</p>

<p>It was a week later before she remembered to speak
of the Mexican woman “who could wash.” The two
women were on their way to their tents from the mess-breakfast.
Señora Maldonado was leaving MacLean’s
tent with a large bundle of used clothes held under her
arm.</p>

<p>“She washes for the men. I’m going to ask her to do
my khakis for me. It’s too much to keep asking those
busy men to see that my bundle of wash is sent out and
brought back.”</p>

<p>“More impossible,” she added, following Gerty into
her tent, “is it to do it myself. It’s too hot. And khakis
are stiff rubbing. Perhaps this woman would be willing
to do all our laundry?”</p>

<p>Gerty had been wondering what she would say to
Innes. The speech which needed only an introduction
was stirred into the open.</p>

<p>“You must not,” her voice trembled with anger, “you
must not ask that woman.”</p>

<p>Innes was staring out of the tent door, watching the
arm of the dredge as it dipped and rose from the river.
She did not see the flag of rage flung in her sister’s
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I don’t care at all how she mangles them, so they are
clean, and <i>I</i> do not have to make them so!” She interpreted
the counsel from experience. She knew the
fastidiousness of Mrs. Hardin. She had no ruffles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
care about. “It’s a blessed miracle to find some one who
will wash for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that.” Each word was curt and icy.
“She is not to be spoken to.”</p>

<p>The girl asked her bluntly what she meant.</p>

<p>“You must not give her your washing—must not speak
to her. I’ve not mentioned it before. I—I hoped it would
not be necessary. Tom told me not to speak of it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tom</i> told you not to speak of it? Not to speak of
what?”</p>

<p>Gerty hesitated. Her husband, having relieved himself
of his scorn, had made her see the necessity for not
repeating that scene in Rickard’s tent. That did not prevent
her speaking of what she herself had seen, what
she surmised. But Innes must not speak of it; their
position practically depended on him, now.</p>

<p>Innes, bewildered, asked her what in the world she
was talking about?</p>

<p>“You must have observed—Mr. Rickard?”</p>

<p>The girl’s ear did not catch the short pause. “Observed
Mr. Rickard?”</p>

<p>“The coolness between us. I scarcely speak to him.
I don’t wish to speak to him.”</p>

<p>When had all this happened, Innes demanded of herself?
Had she been asleep, throwing pity from outdated
dreams?</p>

<p>“I won’t countenance a common affair like that.” Her
eyes, sparkling with anger, suggested jealous wrath to
Innes, who had her first hint of the story. She had
learned never to take the face value of her sister’s verbal
coin; it was only a symbol of value; it stood for something
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Gerty had been suffering with abscessed pride, inflamed
vanity. This was the first relief; the angry venom
spent itself.</p>

<p>The yellow eyes were on the dredge bucket as it swung
across the channel, but they did not register. She was
angry, outraged; she did not know with whom. With
Gerty for telling her, with Rickard, with life that lets
such things be. If Gerty would only stop talking! Why
would she string it out, tell it all over again? She hated
the hints which the accented voice was making. She
jumped up. “Oh, stop it!” She rushed out of the tent,
followed by a strange bitter smile that brought age to the
face of Gerty Hardin.</p>

<p>In her own tent, Innes found excuse for her lack of
self-control. She did not like the color of scandal; she
hated smudge. Gerty had <i>told</i> her nothing, only hinted,
hinted! What was it Tom did not want her to know?
She would not think of it. She would be glad that something
had occurred to check the foolish little woman’s
folly. Gerty had said the whole camp knew it; knew
why the Mexican woman was in camp! She did not
trust Gerty in anything else; why should she trust her
in that? She would not think of it.</p>

<p>True or not, it was better for Tom. She assured herself
that she was glad that something, anything, had
happened before her brother learned the drift of things.
There was nothing now to worry about. She would forget
Gerty’s gossip.</p>

<p>But she remembered it vividly that week as she washed
her own khakis; as she bent over the ironing-board in
Gerty’s sweltering “kitchenette.” She thought of it as
she returned Rickard’s bow in the mess-tent the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
morning; each time they met she thought of it. And it
was in her mind when she met Señora Maldonado by the
river one day, and made a sudden wide curve to avoid
having to speak to her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>TIME THE UMPIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A BLAZING sun rode the heavens. The river was
low; its yellow waters bore the look of oriental duplicity.
Men and horses were being driven to take advantage
of the continued low water. Each day was now
showing its progress. The two ends of the trestle were
creeping across the stream from their brush aprons, as
though sentient, feeling their way; watching the foe;
ready to spring the trap when the river was off guard.</p>

<p>“Things are humming,” wrote MacLean, Jr., to his
father, who was inspecting the survey below Culiacan for
the new line on the west coast. The focus was indeed
visible. A few weeks of work, at the present rate, and
the gap would be closed, Hardin’s big gate in it; the
by-pass ready; the trap set for the Colorado. The tensity
of a last spurt was in the air.</p>

<p>It was inspiring activity, this pitting of man’s cumulative
skill against an elemental force. No Caucasian
mind which did not tingle, feel the privileged thrill of
it. To the stolid native, as he plodded on his raft all
day under a blazing sky, or lifted his machete against
the thorny mesquit or more insidious arrow-weed, this
day of well-paid toil was his millennium, the fulfilment
of the prophecy. His gods had so spoken. Food for
his stomach, liquor for his stupefaction; the white man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
money laid in a brown hand each Sunday morning was
what the great gods forespoke. The completion of the
work, the white man’s victory, would be an end of the
fat time. A dull sense of this deepened the natural
stolidity of their labor. Hasten? Why should they,
and shorten their day of opportunity? Saturday night,
feasting, dancing; then a day of rest, of stupor. To-day
is theirs. The gods are speaking.</p>

<p>Between the two camps oscillated Coronel, silently
squatting near the whites, jabbering his primitive Esperanto
to the tribes. His friendship with the white
chiefs, his age and natural leadership gave him a unique
position in both camps. Forestier consulted him; Rickard
referred to him. He was too lordly to work; long
ago, he had thrown his fate with the Cocopahs whose
name was a synonym for majestic idleness.</p>

<p>“But he’s worth a dozen workers,” Hamlin had once
told Rickard. “Get Coronel on your side. He’s got
influence; they do as he says.” Behind that grizzled
mask, Rickard surmised a pride of authorship in the
reclamation project. Coronel had known Powell; he
had crossed the desert with Estrada; that his proudest
boast. Assiduously, Rickard cultivated the old Indian
who crouched days through by the bank of the river.</p>

<p>The engineers felt the whip of excitement. Silent,
up at the Crossing, at work on the great concrete head-gate,
which would ultimately control the water supply
of the valley, was prodding his men to finish before
the winter storms were on. His loyalty to the Hardin
gate did not admit a contingency there, but it was the
thought which lurked in every man’s mind. Never a
man left his camp in the morning who did not look
toward that span crawling across the treacherous stream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
measure that widened by-pass. Would the gate stand?
Would pilings driven through brush mats into a bed
of silt, a bottomless pit, hold against that river, should
it turn and lash its great tail? The Hardin men halloed
for the gate, but looked each morning to see if it
were still there. The Reclamation Service men and
the engineers of the railroad were openly skeptical; Sisyphus
outdone at his own game! Estrada and Rickard
looked furtively at the gate, with doubt at each other.
Uneasiness electrified the air.</p>

<p>Hardin, himself, was repressed, an eager live wire.
His days he spent on the river; his nights, long hours
of them, open-eyed, on his back, watching the slow-wheeling,
star-pricked dome of desert sky. His was
the suspense of the man on trial; this was his trial;
Gerty, Rickard, the valley, his judge and jury. Gradually,
the peace of the atom lost in infinity would absorb
him; toward morning he would sleep. But the
first touch of dawn would bring him back to the situation;
the sun not so tender as the stars! Dishonored,—he
had to make good, to make good to the men who
loved him, to prove to Gerty who scorned failure— By
the eternal, he must prove to Gerty! She must
give him respect from those scornful eyes of hers. If
ever he had worked, in his life, he must work for his
life now! The gate grew to be a symbol with him
of restored honor, an obsession of desire. It must be
all right!</p>

<p>Rickard was all over the place, up at the Crossing
with Silent at the concrete gate, Marshall’s gate; down
the levee inspecting the bank with untiring vigilance;
watching the mat-makers on the rafts weave their cross-threads
of willow branches and steel cable; directing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
reporting. “Watching every piece of rock that’s dumped
in the river,” complained Wooster. “Believe he marks
them at night!”</p>

<p>They were preparing for the final rush. In a week
or two, the work would be continuous, night-shifts to
begin when the rock-pouring commenced. Large lamps
were being suspended across the channel, acetylene
whose candle-power was that of an arc light. Soon
there would be no night at the break. When the time
for the quick coup would come, the dam must be closed
without break or slip. One mat was down, dropped
on the floor that had already swallowed two such gigantic
mouthfuls; covered with rock; pinned down to
the slippery bottom with piles. Another mat was ready
to drop; rock was waiting to be poured over it; the
deepest place in the channel was reduced from fifteen
to seven feet. Each day the overpour, anxiously measured,
increased. A third steam-shovel had been added;
the railroad sent in several work-trains fully equipped
for service; attracted by the excitement, the hoboes
were commencing to come in, from New Orleans where
the sewer system was finished and throwing men out
of work; from Los Angeles, released by the completion
of the San Pedro breakwater; from San Francisco they
were turning, the excitement over. No fat pickings
there!</p>

<p>It was a battle of big numbers, a duel of great force
where time was the umpire. Any minute hot weather
might fall on those snowy peaks up yonder, and the
released waters, rushing down, would tear out the defenses
as a wave breaks over a child’s fort made of
sand. This was a race, and all knew it. A regular train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
despatch system was in force that the inrushing cars
might drop their burden of rock and gravel and be off
after more. The Dragon was being fed rude meals, its
appetite whetted by the glut of pouring rock.</p>

<p>Tod Marshall came down from Tucson in his car.
The coming of the <i>Palmyra</i> and Claudia rippled the
social waters at the Front for days ahead. Gerty
Hardin, to whom had been rudely flung days of leisure,
though she still hated Rickard, wondered if she were
not glad that her hours were to be her own when the
grand Mrs. Marshall came. For Marshall was a great
man, the man of the Southwest; his wife, whom she
had not yet met, must be a personage. Gerty’s position
as a helper of Ling’s might have been misunderstood.
Yet too proud to tell her astonished family
that she wanted to desert the mess-tent, she shook herself
from her injury, and “did up” all her lingerie
gowns. Mrs. Marshall was not going to patronize her,
even if her husband had snubbed Tom. It was hot,
ironing in her tent, the doors closed. It would have
hurt her to acknowledge the importance of the impending
visit.</p>

<p>Everything carried a sting those indoor hours. She
was aflame with hot vanity. Twice, she had openly
encouraged him; twice, he had flouted her. That was
his kind! Men who prefer Mexicans—! She would
never forgive him, never!</p>

<p>She followed devious channels to involve Tom’s responsibility.
There was a cabal against the wife of
Hardin. Working like a servant! she called it necessity.
Everything, every one punished her for that one
act of folly. Life had caught her. She saw no way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
as she ironed her mull ruffles, no way out of her cage.
Her spirit beat wild wings against her bars. If she
could see a way out!</p>

<p>She really was not free to establish an honest independent
life. Horticulturists speak of the habit of a
plant. Psychologists take the long road and find a
Mediterranean word; temperament. Gerty was a vine;
its habit to cling for support. Her tendrils had been
rudely torn, thrown back at herself; world-winds were
waiting their chance at her—a vine is not a pretty thing
when it trails in the dust— Sometimes she would shiver
over her ironing-board when she thought of the dust.
She knew her habit, which she, too, called temperament.
Nothing to do but to stay with Tom!</p>

<p>Maddening, too, that Rickard would not see that he
had hurt her. His bow was just as friendly as before.
Friendly! Was that all it had ever been? At the
mess-table, she caught his eyes turning toward, resting
on, Innes Hardin. The girl herself did not seem to notice—artful,
subterranean, such stalking! That was
why she had come running back to the Heading!
That the reason of her anger when she had hinted of
the Maldonado. She learned to hate Innes. Before the
girl’s return, she had had a chance; she knew she had
had a chance. He had been caught by youth, ah, that
the truth that seared! Youth! Youth that need not fear
the morning light, the swift passing months! <i>She</i> had
no time to lose. Her heart felt old.</p>

<p>The mess-meals grew intolerable to her. She would
watch for the shock of those conscious glances that she
felt every one must see. She, Gerty Hardin, cast aside
for a hoyden in khakis! The girl’s play at unconsciousness
infuriated her. Deep! Ah, she knew now her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
game! Riding fifteen miles down the levee to pay a
pretended visit to a laborer’s wife, Mrs. Parrish! As
if she were interested in Mrs. Parrish! Jolting in a box-car
to see the concrete head-gate with MacLean; walking
with Estrada, meeting Rickard, of course, everywhere;
her yellow khakis in every corner of the camp.
A promiscuous coquette, she changed the word to “careful”;
playing her cards slowly; waiting for victory to
make a hero of Rickard; pretending to take issue with
Tom—ha, she knew her, at last!</p>

<p>Her first call at the <i>Palmyra</i> discovered the mistress
in a wash gown of obscure cut and color, with a white
apron a serving maid might wear. Knitting her pale-colored
wools, Mrs. Marshall had little to give out but
monosyllables. Gerty was forced to carry the conversation.
Mrs. Marshall did not appear to see her visitor’s
correctness, the harmony of color, the good lines. Time
thrown away, that laundering!</p>

<p>That avenue dull, time again hung heavily. The gay
evenings on the <i>Delta</i> were abandoned; the men coming
back from the river too tired, too warm to dance.
She began to discover it was hideously hot. Perhaps,
she might go out, after all—</p>

<p>She decided to tell her family that it was too warm
to continue the commissary activity; Rickard was enough
of a gentleman to let her cover her hurt; she could safely
assume that! Yet it stung her to think what Innes
might be thinking, what, perhaps, he had told her!
Every one must be wondering, speculating! In her life,
Gerty had felt keenly but twice; each time Rickard it
was who had hurt her. That mocking superior eye of
his! Bitterly she hated him.</p>

<p>“Tom,” she said one night. He turned with a swift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
thrill of expectation, for her voice sounded kind; like the
Gerty of old. “I have always heard that Mr. Marshall
has terribly strict ideas—for every one but himself, I
mean!”</p>

<p>“That’s a good one.” It was the first laugh in weeks
of moodiness. Hardin was thinking of the poker games.</p>

<p>“I’m serious. I think he ought to hear of that Mexican
woman.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything else?”</p>

<p>There was no new thread in her fabric of suspicions.
To Hardin, it brought a memory of time past to be
sitting thus familiarly together, Gerty in her negligee,
her hair disarranged, looking up into his face. He did
not suspect he was a pawn in her scheme of retribution.</p>

<p>“It ought not to be allowed.” The blue eyes were
purpling with anger. “Mr. Marshall ought to be told.
It is demoralizing in a camp like this. I thought you
said the governor of Lower California had sent a commandant
here.”</p>

<p>“To suppress liquor-selling and gambling.” Hardin
did not say that the request had come from Rickard.</p>

<p>“And persons without visible means of support,”
quoted his wife with triumph.</p>

<p>“That does not apply to the Mexican,” frowned Hardin.
He did not want to be dragged into this.</p>

<p>“You ought to tell Mr. Marshall,” persisted Gerty.</p>

<p>“I tell Marshall anything against his pet clerk?” The
Hardin lip shot out. “He’d throw me out of the company.”</p>

<p>The pretty scene was spoiled. To his dismay, she
burst into a storm of tears, tears of self-pity. Her life
lay in tatters at her feet, the pretty fabric rent, torn between
the rude handling of those two men. She could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
not have reasoned out her injury, made it convincing,
built out of dreams as it was, heartless, scheming dreams.
Because she could not tell it, her sobbing was the more
violent, her complaints incoherent. Tom gathered
enough fragments to piece the old story. “Ashamed of
him. He had dragged her down into his humiliation.”
His sweet moment had passed.</p>

<p>He spent a few futile moments trying to comfort her.</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me.” It burst from her; a cry of
revulsion. He stared at her, the woman meeting his eyes
in flushed defiance. The hatred which he saw, her bitterness,
corroded his pride, scorched his self-love. Nothing
would kill his love for her; he knew that in that
blackest of moments. His affection for her was part
of his life. It went cringing to her feet, puppy-like, but
he called it back, whipped it to its place. That was all
over now. No woman could dread him twice like that.
He shivered at what he had seen. The man breathed
deep as he got up and looked about him. It was over.
He would not elaborate his awakening with words. He
would never forget that look of dread, of hate. He
left her tent.</p>

<p>That night, the cot under the stars had no tenant.
Hardin had it out with himself down the levee. Strange
that this bitter man could have the same hopeful blood
in him which had whipped his pulse at Lawrence! He
was still a young man, and God! How tired he was!
He was in a net of bitter circumstance. What was he
to do, where to go? He was too old, too tired and sore
to begin over again, and the bitter irony of it! He only
wanted what he had lost, the love of the woman who
hated him, the respect of the valley into which his life
had been sucked. God! He was tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>He saw the dry forsaken channel of the Colorado;
grim symbol of his life! Where was the youthful hope,
the conviction that everything would come his way? The
potential richness of the soil upturned by yesterday’s
shovel on the dike found him cold. That night, there
was no future to his bitterness. Hunting for the fault,
he found the real Hardin, not the man he had been
spending his days with, the man he had expected to be,
but the man the world saw passing. Perhaps life holds
no more tragic instant than when we stand over the
grave of what we thought we were, throw the sod over
the ashes, facing the lonely yoking with the man that is.
Hardin shivered unto himself; and grew old.</p>

<p>That valley might fulfil Estrada’s vision and his labor;
might yield the harvest of happy homes; but his was not
there. He had been the sacrifice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>THE WALK HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CLAUDIA MARSHALL sat at the head of her
stately table in the <i>Palmyra</i>, mute as a statue
but for the burning eyes which followed her Tod. To
Innes, her guest, she was renewing the impression of
heroic resignation. It was a tragic presence, of brooding
solicitude.</p>

<p>Not easy to believe that this was once the most vivacious
coquette of Guadalajara! The American girl had
often wondered if it had been Tod Marshall’s sentence,
only, which had changed the butterfly into a gentle
martyr. Listening to her brilliant host, she let her mind
wander to the silent woman near her. What was it she
was mourning, her position in San Francisco, the honors
her Tod had had to relinquish? Was worldliness,
thwarted ambition, her sorrow? Then why didn’t she
enjoy the distinctions he poured into her seemingly indifferent
hands, those busy fingers knitting, knitting,
paying no attention to the labels he won? She might
have made a splendid circle, herself the center, if that
<i>was</i> the thing she loved. Eduardo had told her once,
in relating the family history, that the instant Tod Marshall
had risen in Claudia Cardenas’ sky, the coquette
of Guadalajara had left her old orbit; she herself, forever
a satellite, to this new sun. But that could not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
silenced her vivacity, thrown that burning fire into her
tragic eyes!</p>

<p>“I saw Cor’nel to-day, mother!” Innes caught the
opportunity to glance at her. She had her first intuition.
Claudia had flinched! “<i>Mother?</i>”</p>

<p>“That’s a character, Miss Innes! Have you talked
with him?”</p>

<p>“With him!” echoed Innes. “<i>To</i> him! Will he talk?”</p>

<p>“Ah, we are cousins, brothers!” chuckled her host.
And then her discovery intrigued her; she could hear
the words of Tod Marshall; he was telling anecdotes
of the old Indian; faintly, she heard him—“As a fly to
molasses, is Cor’nel to the river;” but her subterranean
thought was with the woman at the head of the table.
Childlessness! Of course. How was it that she had never
sensed it before! That her sentence, her renunciation.
And he calls her “mother!”</p>

<p>A phrase of Marshall’s caught her. “A Yuma, Cor’nel?
I always thought him a Cocopah.”</p>

<p>Marshall’s fine head was thrown back in laughter.
“Too much work, Yuma!” He was mimicking the old
Indian’s laconic brevities. “Marry Cocopah. Go live
Cocopah. No work, Cocopah!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall, it struck Innes, was hastening the
dinner. She overheard her sending back a course. “It’s
too much, Tony!” And as the coffee was being passed,
she could not wait longer to open her work-bag which
she had carried to the table. Her steel needles began to
“put in” the sleeve of an infant sack; white soft worsted,
with a scallop of blue wool. The work did not absorb
her attention. Seemingly, she was engrossed in her Tod.
Though her fingers never faltered, her gaze followed
him. Tragically centered it was to Innes Hardin; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
discovery accenting that sad stare which had the persistence
of polar attraction. He was her universe, of
apprehension, rather than her joy. And the girl, watching,
found a pitiful thought; he was also her limitation;
her fond sentence. Loving him; fearing for him; having
life and love meet, and end in him!</p>

<p>No definite horizon, in truth, here, save as her husband
made, or rose above it. The world, as related to him
only, came to Claudia in her Tucson hotel, or her box
rooms in the <i>Palmyra</i>. Her other interest, the orphanage
of Santa Rosalia at Tucson; for whose babies she
cut and sewed and sent an interminable procession of
tiny garments.</p>

<p>Priestly counsel had turned her to vicarious motherhood.
The priests, never her Tod, had heard her complaints
of her abridged life. The blow that had sent
Tod Marshall to the desert, had forbade her motherhood
She was overflowing with maternal passion. And the
doctors and priests told her that resignation, consecration,
life in a minor key, soft pedal pressed, was the
price she must pay for her few happy months of wifehood.
Into her eyes had come the look that Innes had
found tantalizing; the gaze of fervent abridgment.</p>

<p>She had never grown to feel at ease with her husband’s
countrywomen; and they could not understand
her gulf of silence. The nearest approach to a woman
friendship was with Innes Hardin, and this, without a
bridge of speech. There had been many terrible hours
before the orphans’ call had been heard. Then, those
her Tod did not fill, she learned to crochet into soft
baby-smelling jackets for the Santa Rosalia babies. Some
day, perhaps, she might be brave enough to approach
Tod with her plea; perhaps he might let her take one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
of those helpless darlings. To do that, she must lay bare
her ache to him—not yet had she found the daring.
Until then, the Santa Rosalia Orphanage! Her room at
the Rosales Hotel was lined with work-boxes and knitting
bags filled with tender rainbow wools. Unsewn slips
lay in snowy piles waiting for Tod’s days of absence.
They needed her undivided attention; he liked to see
her listening to him. She had learned to crochet with
her eyes shut that she might work without distracting
him. The balls of wool lost their baby fragrance in the
fumes of his tobacco; that the one dissipation she did
not protest against. Late hours, excitement, might
abridge the life she so passionately policed; but she
would not demand the sacrifice of his cigar. The babies
must have their sacques; so lavender sticks and sachet
bags made a fumigating compromise.</p>

<p>Claudia could not lessen her sorrow by sharing it.
Only by a flash of intuition could Innes have penetrated
her secret. Divined, it chained her sympathy. Her
look listening to Tod Marshall, her memory gathered
pitiful evidence of the renunciation. Dull, never to have
felt it before!</p>

<p>Marshall’s cigar followed the coffee. Tony, the white-capped
Italian cook of the <i>Palmyra</i>, was removing the
cups. Innes was carrying her double interest, listening
to Tod Marshall’s broad sweep, getting a new view-point
as he minimized the local scheme—feeling that silent
presence at the head of the table.</p>

<p>Then something drove Claudia from her mind. What
Mr. Marshall had said swept a disturbing calcium on
Tom. What if, truly, the river fiasco could be traced to
that overzealous hand? To Tom, this undertaking
blotted out the rest of related big endeavor; but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
was not the way her host was looking at it. He was
too courteous to give her discomfort; he had not said
it directly. But always it met her, rose up to smite her,
wherever she was. “If this is a failure, then it’s hell
to pay at Laguna.” That the reason of the importance
of this section; as it affected other enterprise, as it was
related to irrigation in the lump. Not because it was
Tom, who had started it, the general who had conceived
it—Marshall, who with his railroad was carrying it
through. Not for personal reasons; as a block of the
great western activity to fit into its place in the mosaic.
More and more disturbing, her thoughts of Tom!</p>

<p>Can a man change equipment, method, his entire habit
of life, in a five-minute walk from home to office? She
had to meet a question of her host. Yes, she had heard
of Minodoka. Yes, it was a big undertaking. She saw
him well started toward the Salt River country before
she went back to meet her fear. Was it not egotism,
personal pride, that was making her cover her eyes, like
any simple ostrich? <i>Her</i> brother. Assume him anybody
else’s brother! Grant a man a moment of apparent
distinction given him by a distinguishing enterprise.
That moment of distinction his betrayal, unless
the method of the man is big enough to rise equal to it!</p>

<p>Big issues had never found this man, her host, wanting.
He had pulled opportunity from a denying fate;
he had <i>made</i> big issues. It gave her a strange sinking
of the heart as she put him in her brother’s place; the
river then would not be running into a useless sea!
Because he had the trick of success; his big opportunities
did not betray him! Ah, now she had touched the
thought. It paled her pride in being a fervid Hardin.
There was a looseness in the method. The dredge fiasco—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
wild night at the levee—no isolated accidents those.
Hardin’s luck!</p>

<p>A flush of miserable shame came to her. How they
had all been trying to spare her—Eduardo, these kindly
Marshalls—MacLean! She loved Tom just the same,
just as fondly, perhaps more tenderly, even; for the
limitations of his upbringing, his education, he was not
to blame! It did not justify Gerty’s resentments—that
was a personal feeling, a craving for distinction; hers,
a wistful shame that Tom, not being equal to his opportunity,
must drag it down with him, cancel forever
that vision! It must not be a failure—it must succeed!
She was turning, impulsively, to ask Tod Marshall if
he thought, could he think it probable that they would
fail, when a step that sent the blood to her face took the
car’s stairs at two leaps. Now, indeed, the dinner was
spoiled.</p>

<p>“That’s Rickard,” Marshall came back from Salt
River. “I forgot to tell you that I asked him to dinner.
He couldn’t get away. He said he’d run in for coffee.
Hello, Rickard. Thought you’d forgotten us!”</p>

<p>“More coffee, Tony,” ordered Mrs. Marshall, after
she had greeted her guest. “A cup for Mr. Rickard.”</p>

<p>She hadn’t thought of that contingency! She found
herself shaking hands with him. Could he not hear her
mind, ticking away at the Maldonado episode?</p>

<p>Of course, he would insist on seeing her to her tent.
Punctilious, always. Well, she just wouldn’t. She
didn’t know how to prevent it, but she just wouldn’t!
Perhaps, she could slip out, some way. She would watch
her chance. She would ask Mrs. Marshall—that was it,
ask to be shown—anything. Then she would slip away.
Mrs. Marshall’s needles were clicking. Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
were on her Tod’s face, watching for the first sign of
fatigue. Tony carried in liqueurs. Rickard allowed
his glass to be filled, but Innes noted that he did not
touch it. She remembered that he had not refused it
at her sister’s dinner. She was in a mood to carp.</p>

<p>“No spirits, either?” She thought she detected a
mockery akin to hers in Marshall’s tone.</p>

<p>“Can I do what I won’t let my men do, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not smoking yet, I see!”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve learned to dislike it, for myself—”
added Rickard. “Can I talk shop for a while?”</p>

<p>They withdrew to a cushioned window seat. Innes
could hear bits of their talk. Rickard, she gathered, was
urging a warm protest against a policy of his superior.
She caught enough scraps to piece together their opposition.
“Reclamation Service,” “Interference,” “A
clean slate—” and then “We’re handicapped enough,” she
heard Rickard say, and then caught a quick glance in
her direction.</p>

<p>Marshall’s answer was judicial. Again Innes got the
wide view, the broad sweep. She remembered what
Eduardo Estrada had told her of Rickard’s complications.
This was what they were talking of. Marshall
advocated a hospitality to their ideas, if set; “Where it
is possible. ‘Be soople, Davy, in things immaterial,’”
he twinkled. “Remember your Stevenson? Government
men are a bit stilted, and we rough railroad men
can teach them a point or two, I agree with you, but
we’re looking far ahead, Rickard. And it’s all the same
thing, Laguna, Imperial. If it’s to be the same system,
stands to reason they want it done their way, eh? Can’t
see it? Wait till you’re old like me.”</p>

<p>His Claudia looked at him with quick anxiety. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
was not old. And he looked well. Sometimes, she almost
believed he <i>was</i> well. That terrible sword—</p>

<p>Innes had found her chance. She asked to be shown
over the car. Mrs. Marshall put aside her wools and
led the way through Tony’s domain, who would have
had them linger. A large diamond blazing on his finger
pointed out ingenious cubby-holes and receptacles. He
wanted to tell the young lady of his wonderful luck;
how he had been picked up by Mr. Marshall—half dead
in San Francisco—and brought down to the Southwest.
He had not coughed for a month. He tried to tell her
of his brilliant salary, “one hundred and fifty, Mex.,”
but his mistress abridged his confidences.</p>

<p>“Tony would talk all night,” she explained as she
led the way back through the sitting-room to her sleeping
compartment.</p>

<p>Here Innes confided her plan. She wanted to slip out.
“She would not interrupt their evening; Mr. Marshall
had business to discuss—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall would not hear of it. She felt that
Tod’s evening had been long enough; that he should be
in bed after his long day of observation on the river.
But she said that Mr. Marshall would never forgive
her if she let Miss Hardin go home alone. Her opposition
was softly implacable.</p>

<p>Innes went back to the sitting-room of the car angrily
coerced. Rickard was still closeted, conversationally,
with his superior.</p>

<p>She endured a half-hour of crippled conversation.
She, herself, was not easily vocal. She felt that Mrs.
Marshall liked her in her own silent remote way, but
they needed Tod Marshall to bridge over the national
gap. Swift fraternization, as between socially equipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
women, was not possible with them. She tried many
subjects. There were no points of contact, she told herself.</p>

<p>At last, desperately, she rose to go. Of course, he
must insist upon going with her. Of course!</p>

<p>“I was going back early, anyway. I’m to be up at
dawn to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The good-bys were said. She found herself walking
rebelliously by his side. “No, thank you!” to the offer
of his arm.</p>

<p>The night was bright with stars. “Bright as day,
isn’t it?” Because her voice was curt, and she had not
used his name, the rising inflection helped a little! Hateful,
to stumble over a rut in the road! Of course, he’d
make her take his arm! Of course!</p>

<p>Rickard grasped her elbow. She walked along, her
head high, her cheeks flaming, anger surging through her
at his touch.</p>

<p>Stupid to press this companionship, this awkward
silence on her. If he thought she was going to entertain
him, as Gerty did, with her swift chatter, he’d be
surprised! Any other two people would fall into easy
give-and-take, but what could she, Innes Hardin, find to
chatter about with this man stalking along, grimly grasping
her arm? Close as they were, his touch reminding
her every minute, between them walked her brother and
her brother’s wife—and there was the Mexican—hateful
memory! Of course, she could not be casual. And
she would not force it. He had brought this about.
Let him talk, then!</p>

<p>Oppressive that silence. Then it came to her that she
would ask him the question that his coming had aborted.
A glance at his face found him smiling. He found it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
amusing? Not for worlds, then, would she speak. And
they stalked along. Unconsciously, she had pulled herself
away from him. He took her hand, and put it in
the crotch of his arm. “That’s better,” he said. She
wondered if he were still smiling.</p>

<p>Their path led by his tent. Neither of them noticed
a subdued light through the canvas walls. As they
reached the place, a figure darted from the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, señor, I thought you would never come.” It
was the wife of Maldonado. Her expression was lost
on Innes. The face was quivering with terror.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rickard,” Innes’ words like icicles, “I will leave
you here. It is quite unnecessary to come farther.”
Quite unveiled her meaning!</p>

<p>It came so quickly that he was not ready; nor indeed
had Gerty’s innuendos yet reached him. But the situation
was uncomfortable. He turned sharply to the Mexican.
“What are you doing here at this hour?”</p>

<p>“Oh, señor,” she gasped. “It is the worst. The señor
said I was not to go home; and I tried, <i>Dios mio</i>, how
I tried to obey. But the children, little Rosita, not yet
four? How could I know that that woman fed them,
or combed their hair? I crept in, just to see—and <i>Dios
mio</i>!” She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he took her roughly by the arm. She
would wake up the camp with her crying. He put her
in a chair. “Now tell your story.” The woman had got
to be a nuisance. He couldn’t have her coming around
like this. He had seen that look in the girl’s eyes—the
Mexican’s rocking grief was theatric. He wouldn’t
have her coming around. It didn’t look right—“Murdered?
Who did you say was murdered?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>She lifted a face, frightened into haggardness. “Maldonado
and the girl.”</p>

<p>The night was stripped to the tragedy. “You found
them?”</p>

<p>Her face was lifted imploringly to his. “The señor
knew best. I should never have gone. Will they come
after me? Will they come and take me?” Her terror
was physical. Her teeth were chattering. She was exhausted
from running. She had stumbled, blindly, the
distance between the camp and her home. “Oh, señor, it
was not I. By the Mother of Christ, it was not I.”</p>

<p>Rickard was not sure. Her fear made him suspect
her. “Who was it, you think?”</p>

<p>“Felipe,” she gasped.</p>

<p>“But they took him to Ensenada, you said;” Rickard
was inclined to think the murderer was before him.</p>

<p>“No, señor. He got away from the rurales—he came
back. He went home—there was no one there. Some
one told him where she had gone. He came to Maldonado’s.
Lucrezia, the eldest, opened the gate. He was
terrible, she said. He rushed past her. And when he
came out, his hands were red. The children heard cries.
They were afraid to go in. I got there last night. I
went in. They were not quite cold—I was afraid to
stay. It would look like me, señor. I made the children
stay behind. They could not run so fast.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it was Felipe?” sternly asked
Rickard.</p>

<p>“A long scar, señor, from here to here,” she motioned
from lip to ear. “Lucrezia had seen him. Will they
take me, señor?” She was a wreck of terror.</p>

<p>“Not if what you tell me is true. Now, get to bed.
I’ll give you something that will make you sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“But the children?”</p>

<p>“Nothing can be done to-night. Drink this.” He
was not sure yet that she was telling him the truth. “I’ll
send MacLean down in the morning.” He hustled her
out of the tent.</p>

<p>He wondered as he got into bed as to the truth of her
story. Disgusting, such animal terror! Awkward hole,
that. Fate seemed possessed to queer him with those
Hardins!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>A DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE murder of Maldonado shook the camp next
morning. The wife had run from Rickard’s tent
to Mrs. Dowker, who had put the hysterical creature to
bed. All night, she babbled of her horror. There had
been no sleep at the Dowkers’; the boy woke up shrieking
with fright at the strange sobbing. Dowker spoke
of it at the mess-tent at breakfast; an hour later, Rickard
met the story there. He wondered if it had yet
reached Hardin’s sister. He decided to send MacLean
down to the house of the oleander to get at the facts.</p>

<p>He was rushing MacLean through the morning’s dictation,
when three rurales, in brilliant trappings, rode
up to his ramada. They looked like stage-soldiers, small
and pompous in their spectacular uniforms and gold-laced
hats. The leader, entering the office, announced
that they were on the track of a criminal, the murderer
of a rurale, Maldonado. The crime had occurred two
nights ago, down the river. The señor knew the place.
There was a famous oleander—</p>

<p>“Do you know who it was?” Rickard felt sure of the
answer. He himself thought that the murderer lay sleeping
in Mrs. Dowker’s tent.</p>

<p>The spokesman of the party, of fierce mustaches, and
glittering bullion, surprised him. “An Indian, named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
Felipe.” He repeated the story Rickard had heard before.
Felipe had escaped his guards, the companions
of the speaker. They had followed him, tracked him to
his home; then, conclusively on to the adobe of the
oleander where Maldonado and the woman were found—butchered.
It was quite clear. He had left a stupid
trail behind him of noisy threats, revenge—</p>

<p>“Maldonado’s girl herself opened the door for him;
she saw him run out. Oh, he will be shot for this. Maldonado
was a good officer.”</p>

<p>Rickard did not feel called upon to question the adjective.
The evil place would be closed; the commandant
would see to that. He asked about the dead man’s children,
if they were still at the adobe—</p>

<p>“An Indian woman, their only neighbor, is with them.
They will be cared for. Would the señor give his respected
permission for notices to be posted about the
camp? A description of the Indian, a reward for his
capture; the favor would be inestimable.”</p>

<p>Rickard took the placard, written in fairly correct
English and Spanish. The government of Mexico was
calling its people to capture “One Felipe, Indian, belonging
to the tribe of Cocopahs. His skin dark to blackness,
with high cheek-bones, and an old fading scar,
bluish, which runs from mouth to ear. Five feet, eight
inches tall, with black hair reaching below his shoulders.
One hundred dollars reward for his arrest, or apprehension.
When last seen, he was wearing blue cotton
trousers, a faded cotton shirt. The fugitive speaks
Spanish, a little broken English and several Indian dialects.”</p>

<p>The two solemn rurales stood at attention as the resplendant
officer repeated his convictions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“He is somewhere in the river-bed, otherwise we
would have found him. The thick undergrowth shelters
him, señor. He is skulking somewhere between Hamlin’s
and Maldonado’s. He has had a start of twenty-four
to thirty-six hours, maybe more, but then—our
horses, señor! If we may be allowed to post these notices,
we will then push up to Hamlin’s Crossing. A
posse is scouring the country around Maldonado’s. He
will not escape.”</p>

<p>Rickard gave the card back to the pompous little officer
whose sword and spurs clanked as he bowed over
it. He thanked the señor eternally for his attention and
courtesy. He saluted again, wheeled, marching out of
the ramada, with his stage-soldiers.</p>

<p>Rickard saw the notice later that day. It was nailed
to the back platform of the <i>Palmyra</i>. He was on
Marshall’s trail, his chief having failed to keep an appointment
with him. They were to test the gate that
afternoon; Marshall was returning soon to Tucson.</p>

<p>Rickard found Claudia in the darkened car reading
a note from her husband. With a rising inflection that
did not escape him, she told her visitor that her husband
had been called to Yuma on business.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s so,” cooperated Rickard, concealing his
amusement at Marshall’s truancy. “I’d forgotten about
that business.” Claudia Marshall had reason for her
anxiety. But not for wifely worry would he mention
that forgotten appointment at the river!</p>

<p>“He may be kept late, he says.” Rickard was conscious
that she was watching his face. “He says not to
wait up. <i>That</i> means late hours. Oh, Tod ought not!
Every time, his cough comes back—” He had caught
her off guard. Her fears were a crucifixion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>In Tucson, Rickard had heard a dwarfing version of
over-solicitude. Since he had been with them at the
river, the thing smacked to him of tragedy. He had
seen the gentle rogue slip that wistful bridle before. Her
eyes, to him, looked robbed. Why should she not grudge
each unnatural night, insist on life at her terms instead
of the full-blooded recklessness of his?</p>

<p>He left the car musing on marital ironies. Daring adventure
to throw together a team of unmatched natures,
gambling on exteriors—as teams are chosen. Without
a driver, he followed his thought whimsically, what team
left so to itself would not smash its harness? Terrible
plunge, that! What can two people, neighbors even,
know of congeniality, that mutual delight which must
survive the nagging friction of every-day life? Harder
for a man to know the nature of the woman he picks
out, than for the girl. She has his work as a guide;
she can guess at temperament and taste. What guide
has a man in the choice of the home-bred girl, the only
sort he himself could imagine being willing to pin his
faith to? Modern life, the home, shelters the woman;
she has no profession to betray her taste or disposition.
In a place like this, it’s different. Camp life shows up
the real man or woman. A good preliminary course,
that, in matrimony, love-sick couples, made to work out
a probation in a rough camp, the woman to cook, the
man to hunt for grub and fire-wood! Fewer marriages,
perhaps, but then not so many divorces.</p>

<p>A group of Indian children were playing under a
clump of willows, directing a mimic stream through a
canal of their own making. Even the children were playing
the river game! He stopped to watch their mimicry.
A pool of deserted water lay caught in a depression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
The little brown hands had raised a labored levee,
had scooped out the return canal.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Rickard. An engineering problem
had stopped their game. The stream, returning, threatened
to overwhelm their breastworks. “Do it this way.”
The miniature of a stolid bronze buck looked up uncomprehendingly.
Rickard tried Spanish. The children
shook their heads. He got down on his knees, and in
a few minutes straightened out the rebellious river.
Many a year since he had played with kids! The little
faces looking up at him, the confidence, stirred quiescent
longings. He was no longer what one would call a
young man. He was living so hurriedly that he was
allowing life in its great, sweet solemn meaning to pass
him by. It was always <i>mañana</i> with him, or <i>pasada
mañana</i>. And he was getting along!</p>

<p>Stretching the kinks in his legs, he continued his walk.
He would take a look at the levee while he was there.
The youngsters’ problem recurred to him. He had had
a new thought back there. He pulled a note-book from
his pocket, scrawling as he went. An idea pulled him
stock-still. Why not, he asked himself with some excitement?
Custom says <i>borrow-pits on the outside</i>.
What was the origin of that custom?</p>

<p>“Is not our problem different?” he demanded. “A
dike is placed usually to protect immediately usable land.
Not so, here. Well, then, why?” The borrow-pit must
be a menace on the stream side, must expose fallible softness
to floods—queer he hadn’t thought of that before.
He must think that well over before he made a change,
but it certainly did look reasonable to him.</p>

<p>He hailed Parrish, down the levee a distance. Parrish
was the foreman of that section of levee, in charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
of a big gang of Indians and hoboes. He came up
running.</p>

<p>“Go slowly here,” advised his chief. “I may change
the orders. Going to open up muck-ditches this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Parrish thought that they might, late.</p>

<p>“Wait to see me. Come up to camp this evening.
I’ll go over it by myself first. I’ll talk it over with you.”</p>

<p>Parrish asked hesitatingly would the next night do as
well? He had promised Mrs. Parrish to go to Yuma
to fetch some medicines she needed. She wasn’t well,
but if it was pressing—</p>

<p>“Surely, go,” agreed Rickard. “But you will be passing
the camp. Lay off early to-night, and start in time
to have a talk with me before going to Yuma. Here,
this is what I’m figuring on.” He wanted to try it on
the practical mind, unbiased by conventions. He drew
his idea again, elaborating the suggestion of inside borrow-pits.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why it isn’t right,” frowned Parrish,
whose ideas grew slowly.</p>

<p>“I believe it <i>is</i> right. But I’ll go over it carefully at
the office. Drop in early. I’ll give you your orders for
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Rickard turned back toward camp, deep in his thought;
so intent that a sharp cry had lost its echo before the
import came to him. He stopped, hearing running steps
behind him. Innes Hardin was loping up the bank like
a young deer, with terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rickard,” she cried, “Mr. Rickard!”</p>

<p>She was trembling. Her fright had flushed her;
cheek to brow was glowing with startled blood. He
saw an odd flash of startling beauty, the veil of tan torn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
off by her emotion. The wave of her terror caught him.
He put out his hand to steady her. She stood recovering
herself, regaining her spent breath. Rickard remembered
that this was the first time he had seen her since
the murder of Maldonado, since the meeting with the
Mexican woman at his tent. “What was it frightened
you?”</p>

<p>“The Indian, the murderer. Just as they describe
him on those notices, the high cheek-bones, the scar, a
terrible gaunt face. I must have fallen asleep. I’d
been reading. I heard a noise in the brush, and there
was his face staring at me. Foolish how frightened I
was.” Her breath was still uneven. “I screamed and
ran. Silly to be so scared.”</p>

<p>He started toward the willows, but she grabbed his
sleeve. “Oh, don’t.” She flushed, thinking to meet the
quizzical smile, but his eyes were grave. He, too, had
had his fright. They stood staring at each other. “I’m
afraid—” she completed. How he would despise her
cowardice! But she could not let him know that her
fear had been for him!</p>

<p>He was looking at her. Suppose anything had happened
to her! He had a minute of nausea. If that brute
had hurt her—and then he knew how it was with him!</p>

<p>He looked at her gravely. Of course. He had known
it a long time. It was true. She was going to belong
to him. If that brute had hurt her!</p>

<p>She shrank under his gravity; this was something
she did not understand. They were silent, walking toward
the encampment. Rickard did not care to talk.
It was not the time; and he had been badly shaken.
Innes was tremulously conscious of the palpitating silence.
She fluttered toward giddy speech. Her walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
that day, Mr. Rickard! She had heard that water had
started to flow down the old river-bed; she had wanted
to see it, and there was no one to go with her. Her
sentence broke off. The look he had turned on her was
so dominant, so tender. Amused at her giddiness, and
yet loving her! Loving her! They were silent again.</p>

<p>“You won’t go off alone, again.” He had not asked
it, at parting. His inflection demanding it of her, was
of ownership. She did not meet his eyes.</p>

<p>Later, when she was lying on her bed, face downward,
routed, she tried to analyze that possessive challenge
of his gaze, but it eluded words. She summoned her
pride, but the meaning called her, sense and mind and
soul of her. It cried to her: “I, Casey Rickard, whom
your brother hates, once the lover of Gerty Holmes, I
am the mate for you. And I’m going to come and take
you some day. Some day, when I have time!”</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she was angry with him; she had some pride.
“Why didn’t he tell me then?” she cried in a warm
tumult to her pillow. “For I would have given him his
answer. I had time, ample time, to tell him that it was
not true.” For she wanted a different sort of lover, not
a second-hand discard; but one who belonged all to herself;
one who would woo, not take her with that strange
sure look of his. “You’ll be waiting when I come.”
Ah, she would not, indeed! She would show him!</p>

<p>And then she lay quite still with her hand over her
heart. She <i>would</i> be waiting when he came for her!
Because, though life had brought them together so
roughly, so tactlessly had muddled things, yet she knew.
She would be waiting for him!</p>

<p>Before he had left her, Rickard had followed a swift
impulse. Those bronze lamps averted still? Was she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
remembering—last night? No mistake like that should
rest between them. He must set that straight. That
much he allowed himself. Until his work was done.
But she knew—she had seen—how it was with him!</p>

<p>“I wonder if you would help me, Miss Hardin? Would
you do something for that poor crazed woman? I
wanted to ask Mrs. Hardin, but for some reason I’ve
got into her black books. The Mexican needs help,—she
ran away from her children, she thought the suspicion
would fall on her—I suppose we must not blame
her for cowardice. Just the little kindness one woman
can give another. A man finds it difficult. And these
Mexican women don’t understand a man’s friendship.”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his squarely. His tantalizing smile had
gone. He was making a demand of her—to believe
him, his request his defense. The glances, of yellow
eyes and gray, met with a shock, and the world was
changed for both. Life, with its many glad voices, was
calling to senses and spirit, the girl’s still rebellious, the
man’s sure.</p>

<p>It was the serene hour of the day. The work of the
day was done, save Ling’s and the river shifts’. The
wonderful slow evening of the desert was unfolding. Beyond,
the distant deep-shadowed mountains, which shut
them out from the world, made a jagged rent across the
sky.</p>

<p>Rickard pulled himself free from the solemnity of that
moment. They were to be friends—first! He sought
her eyes. Good! They were not to be enemies any
more!</p>

<p>He put out his hand. “Good night!” To both, it
carried the sound of “I love you!” She put her hand
in his, then tore her fingers away, furious with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
for clinging. Where was her pride? When he had
time!</p>

<p>She fled into her tent, his look from which all laughter
had faded, following her.</p>

<p>Neither of them had seen Gerty Hardin watching
them from her tent door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>

<small>THE FACE IN THE WILLOWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT evening, in her tent by the river-bed, Mrs.
Parrish thought that she heard a noise outside. She
had been lying down, a wet cloth pressed over her eyes
which would twitch in spite of desperate effort. She
had sent Sam to Yuma for ammonia and headache powders,
and for valerian; the last for her nerves.</p>

<p>It was only the wind rustling the river willows, but it
startled her every time. She wished that she had not
let him go. The headache, the twitching, was easier to
stand than loneliness. She kept her nerves on edge
listening for noises. That noise again! Some one was
surely prowling about the tent. She raised her head,
straining her ears. There was no sound without. She
was unstrung. All that excitement about the murder of
Maldonado had made her scary. There, what was that?</p>

<p>She tore the wet rag from her eyes and jumped up.
A face haggard and wild was staring at her through
the screen-wire door. The twilight was lingering; the
long warm dusk of the desert. She could see that it was
an Indian, and her blood froze; for a purple scar twisted
his face.</p>

<p>She had seen the rurales nail a notice on the tool
house down the river that very morning. She had
braved the fierce noon sun to read it. The description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
was burned in red letters on her memory. “High cheek-bones,
long streaming hair. Faded cotton shirt, a scar
from mouth to ear!”</p>

<p>“Bread,” the voice grated on her. “<i>Dame el pan</i>,
señora. Love of Gord, bread, señora. <i>Pi</i>-why. <i>La-hum-pah.</i>”</p>

<p>Her flesh chilling, she was backing cautiously toward
the table. He must not guess what she was seeking.</p>

<p>She found it difficult to enunciate. Her tongue was
thick. “You understand camp? Indian Camp?” He
shook his head. She was still backing, retreating toward
her revolver. “Camp,” she insisted. “Indians
have bread, mucho. Go there. Get bread, mucho,
there.”</p>

<p>“Bread,” he pleaded. “Bread, señora. <i>Hambreando!</i>”</p>

<p>Starving! She knew what that meant. Then he was
dangerous. To save herself, she would give him bread,
but she was afraid to open the door. Every Indian
tragedy she had ever read shook her then with terror.
She was groping blindly, her hand behind her, over the
crowded surface of the table. She struck against the
cold steel butt of the gun. Her fingers curled around it.</p>

<p>“Go away,” she repeated. “Man come pretty soon.”
He would know what that meant. She lifted her revolver,
and the face left the door.</p>

<p>She dared not now have a light. Her heart was bursting.
If it would not pound so! She must quiet it, so
she could breathe, so she could shoot. How could she
be calm? She was thinking of the things the Indians
do to people, to people who have not harmed them; of
scalping, of tortures. Sam said these Indians were
gentle; but he had said her tent would not blow down.
He would not deceive her. He did not know. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
man had killed two innocent people. Perhaps they had
refused to give him bread.</p>

<p>How badly Sam would feel that he had left her;
things always happened when he was away. But she
had urged him; she could not stand the pain another
night. The night! It stretched before her, a long torture
of fear.</p>

<p>She caught a sound at the rear of the tent. That light
screen door, held only by a thin hook! Any child could
break that down. Why had she let Sam go? He was
scarcely on his way. Two hours to get there, if he was
lucky and his horse not too tired. An hour to rouse the
drug clerk, and get the drugs—two hours back. God!
she would go mad!</p>

<p>She strained her ears to listen, the silence of the desert
falling like lead on her ear-drum. There was that
stealthy step again, moving around the tent! She would
have to do something. She must give him bread if he
was starving. Hunger makes men desperate. He had
been in hiding for two days, she had heard the rurales
tell Sam. Perhaps he had eaten nothing since that time—she
shivered at the picture she conjured of the dead
man and woman. She wondered why he had killed
them? Just because he was starving, because they refused
to give him bread? She wondered if he had tortured
them, scalped them? When he came into her
vision again, well in front of the tent, she would hurl
a loaf out the back door, and hook it before he could
get back there. Perhaps he would go away, if she gave
him something to eat.</p>

<p>The voice came whining through her door again.</p>

<p>“Bread, señora, bread, señora!”</p>

<p>Her gun in one hand, firmly clenched, she groped in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
a starch box with her left for the bread. Then, swift as
a shot, she opened the rear door and threw the soggy
loaf of her own making into the gathering shadows.</p>

<p>“There, bread!” she cried. She heard the sound of
running steps. Then fell a silence that pounded at
her ears. She stood it as long as she could. She had to
see if he had gone; what was he doing? She peered
through the front screen door. On the ground, close
by, sat the Indian, tearing his loaf, gnawing it like a
beast, looking the beast, his eyes wild and menacing.</p>

<p>She shivered. “Go away,” she said, pointing to the
river-growth with her revolver. “Man come back;
soon!”</p>

<p>He grabbed up his loaf to his cotton shirt, and ran
toward the river-bank, a dark clump of willows receiving
him. Even then she was afraid to leave the door.
He might come back. She stood there, her eyes fixed on
that clump of willows which had swallowed him, as the
desert stars came pricking through the soft drop-curtain
of the sky. Her eyes had to strain through the uncertain
light, pale starshine and vague twilight. She could
barely make out the outlines of the shrubs.</p>

<p>Once she thought he was returning; there was a movement
in the willows as a breeze waved the supple
branches. Her finger sought the trigger. Cold they
were, and stiff. Suppose she could not press it? Perhaps
she could not shoot! Her legs, too, were numb
from standing. She wanted a chair, but her eyes must
not leave for one second that dark spot of bank. She
remembered a pine box she used for a supplementary
table. If she could but reach that! Her unoccupied
hand groped through the darkness. Then she tried her
foot. A sharp broken scream burst from her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
shook,—with fear, but of course he could not have crept
in! She would have heard him break the door. Foolish,
to be so nervous. That was only the box she had
felt, the box with a woolen cloth over it, the green and
yellow portière from Coulter’s, Chicago. Was it Coulter’s?
Where <i>was Coulter’s</i>? How her head pounded!</p>

<p>She must not let herself go like that. She must control
herself. She had a long night ahead of her.</p>

<p>For an instant, as she relaxed her stiffened muscles
toward the pine box, her sharp gaze wavered from the
dark spot on the river-bank. She pulled herself together
sharply; she must not let him surprise her, steal on her.
She must be on guard. Her finger found the trigger
again. Why had she sent Sam? Oh, why had she ever
let him leave her?</p>

<p>The stars were coming out in numbers now. Increasingly,
their lamps fell on the cleared space between the
tent and the dark river-line. A broad band of star-washed
sand lay between her and the skulking figure in
the brush, the Indian who had murdered Maldonado.
She would see him the instant he stepped out on that
belt of light. If she kept her eyes fixed—they must not
stray. Before he could reach her, she would shoot.
She would have no scruples. He had had none for that
man and woman down yonder. She wondered if they
were young, if it was for bread he had killed them.</p>

<p>Why was she alone? She couldn’t remember. It
made her head hurt to think. She was always alone in
this desert. Why had she made Sam bring her to such
a place, when he wanted to stay home with the folks
and the doctor? Why had they come? Oh, yes, she remembered.
Their tent had blown down, their Nebraska
tent. Funny to see it come down, the dishes all smashing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
What a noise they made. It made her laugh to
think of it. How it made her laugh! Ssh. She must
not laugh. He would hear her over there. He would
come creeping back, to leer at her.</p>

<p>What was that smell? Rice, burning rice and scorched
codfish. She always let rice burn. She could never remember
to control that blue flame, no, it was a yellow
flame, long fingers of yellow fire, like the rays of the
sun in the desert. Or was it Nebraska? What a smell
that was! And she could not leave the door, nor take
her eyes from the clump of willows because the company’s
automobile would be coming upon her, and she
with her purple waist on.</p>

<p>What was she thinking of? Nothing was burning.
That had happened long ago, before the scorpion frightened
her, before the tent blew down back in Nebraska.
She couldn’t think straight, she was getting sleepy. She
must shake it off. Until Sam came back from the levee
with the bottles of rice. She knew what those Indians
did to people, hungry Indians. They cut off your scalp.
Her hairpins might save her, wire hairpins.</p>

<p>The Wistaria. What made her think of that? That
was where the good doctor lived who knew what was
the matter with her. No—that was Nebraska. But
there were no tents in Nebraska. Her head hurt. She
wished he would come, or Sam.</p>

<p>There, a movement in the brush. She must be all
ready to shoot. Suppose she could not pull the trigger?
Her fingers were like bits of steel. Sam would come
home and find her lying there, her scalp gone. How
funny she would look. Ssh, she must not laugh. The
Indian did not like it. He killed anybody who laughed.
Sam had told her so. From his hiding-place, she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
see the Indian shake his finger at her. No, it was a willow
branch.—She must be calm!</p>

<p>Sam would be sorry that he had had a headache. It
must have been a bad headache, or he would not have
left her. He had to get that codfish for his head. No,
it was rice; burning rice.</p>

<p>Her eyes burned. If the willows moved, could she
see them? She wondered if she should blink to rest
those burning balls, would he see it and rush at her,
break down that door, barred with a wire hairpin?</p>

<p>She had been sitting there for years. Sam was never
coming back. Her gun lay on her knees; her finger
touched the trigger. Oh, she could not keep awake any
longer. She was slipping, slipping off to—somewhere.
The Wistaria. She would bite her lip. That would pull
her back. But she could not find her lip. It was running
away from her.</p>

<p>There was a stealthy creeping sound outside the tent.
She could not see anything. But her eyes pained so.
Perhaps he was creeping. A shadow fell between her
and the stars. A cautious hand tried the latch.</p>

<p>She fell to low shaking laughter. Funny, he thought
he could get in! He didn’t know the door was barred—an
Indian fooled by a wire hairpin! He could never
get in. He would hear her laughing. It would make
him angry.</p>

<p>“Lizzie!”</p>

<p>The laughter stopped. He knew her name. He was
trying to trick her, to make his voice sound like Sam’s.</p>

<p>Her voice was thick with strangled laughter. “Can’t
come in. Can’t get in. Barred, hairpin.”</p>

<p>“Lizzie!”</p>

<p>“Say, ‘señora.’ Go away. Man come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>“Lizzie!” There was an impact of determined muscle
against wood, the door-jamb splintering. A stifled
scream rose toward the desert stars. The door fell in.
A different sound split the air; another cry in a deeper
key, and a man’s body fell across her knees. Some
bottles crashed to the floor. There was a swift odor of
spilled ammonia, of valerian.</p>

<p>Something was burning again! Rice. Burning on
her knees. She couldn’t shake it off. Why didn’t some
one come and take off this dead Indian? He hadn’t got
her scalp. It made her laugh—hush, she must call. She
fell to screaming; low terrible cries, thick and muffled,
coming through her twitching and twisted mouth.</p>

<p>She was sitting there the next morning when they
found her, the body of Sam Parrish shot to the heart,
lying at her feet. Her empty gun lay on her knees; her
finger at the trigger. Her eyes stared into the willows.
They thought her dead until they touched her. Then
she screamed!</p>

<p>They carried her out of the valley the next day, still
screaming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV<br>

<small>A GLIMPSE OF FREEDOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE siding was deserted. The <i>Palmyra</i> had run
out to Tucson, carrying Marshall and Claudia with
her tender-hued, baby-smelling wools. Of that little
party, Tony made perhaps the larger gap, Tony with his
diamond blazing on his finger, his “holdouts,” left-overs
from the Marshall table, and his case of smuggled triple
X whisky. The young fellows encouraged his stories
of old San Francisco, of Bliss and his yellow tips, of
wonderful dinners, of the Bush Street Theater when McCullough
and Barrett were there. Ah, those the only
days! A forefinger would flank Tony’s wicked eye.</p>

<p>Marshall had gone without apprehension. They did
not expect now to have setbacks, to have to extend the
time set for the ultimate diversion. The days were flowing
like oil.</p>

<p>The encampment was filling up with visitors, newspaper
men who came to report the spectacular capture
of the river. Gerty was finding some opportunities for
her chafing-dish and lingerie gowns, but the fish felt
small to her net. The attention she received assuaged
little of her pride. “At any rate, Rickard will see it.”
On the <i>Delta</i>, for the young engineers were relaxing
again toward hospitality, she was a belle. Every afternoon,
she served tea to a small court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>Brandon came down, sent by the <i>Sun</i>, his old paper.
Rickard had the newcomer’s tent pitched next his own.
He was anticipating snatches of intimacy with this cosmopolitan,
whose sweetness he felt sure was the ripe
result of some deep experience. His few hours in the
Imperial tent had discovered to him a rare brain. He
was keen to see more of him.</p>

<p>The day after his arrival, Brandon sent a telegram to
his wife. He told Rickard about it afterward.</p>

<p>“I suppose I should have asked you first,” he admitted.
“I may have taken a liberty!”</p>

<p>“I think you couldn’t do that,” smiled Rickard. “This
camp is yours, señor!”</p>

<p>“Impulse does not often carry me away.” The trim-cut,
dog-like face of the irrigationist frowned. “I should
have asked you. But seeing other women here gave me
the idea, I suppose. I telegraphed for Mrs. Brandon
to join me here.”</p>

<p>Deliberately Rickard controlled the muscles of his
face. Every one else knew what he thought about women
in camp. He hoped that he would not be quoted to
Brandon.</p>

<p>“It is a little different, I think, from ordinary cases,”
Brandon was working up a justification. “Mrs. Brandon
is a writer of fiction, of some note. You have run
across her books, her pen name—George Verne.”</p>

<p>Rickard’s face held back the surprise of it. A smile
suffused his mind. Brandon, the classicist, the <i>Sun’s</i>
pet man, a specialist on irrigation, related by marriage
to <i>The Cowboy’s Bride</i>! He acknowledged that he
knew her by name, had seen her books. He had been
in remote places, where English matter is scarce, and
had often found George Verne usurping the shelves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>“I should think she would find this an opportunity,”
he agreed. He had caught a hint of returning fires in
the calm gray eyes.</p>

<p>The thin lips were pursed musingly. “But it is pretty
hard for her to leave New York. Her publishers keep
her pretty busy.”</p>

<p>Rickard’s silence was not inactive. He was thinking
of the diverted lives; of Brandon living out his banishment
in a western desert tent; George Verne weaving
her stories hundreds of miles away in a New York apartment-house.</p>

<p>“The separation is hard on both of us.” The man was
revealing his renunciations in this instant of homesickness;
his guards were down. “When my trouble came,
I had hoped that her work might make it possible for
her to come out with me, at least half her time, that
she might gather material. But they crowd her with
orders; she works right through the hot summers; I
don’t remember when she has taken a vacation. I run
out once in a while to try to stop her, to make her play
a little. But my cough comes back; she has the habit
of grind by this time. I’m hoping this will appeal to her
as a chance; it’s a tremendous setting, this!”</p>

<p>He chatted about valley happenings for a few minutes
before leaving.</p>

<p>“Anything I can do for you?” inquired Rickard.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no. I’m off now to the Crossing to see
Marshall’s gate. And I want to see Matt Hamlin. He
was my host once, years ago.”</p>

<p>Rickard’s mail that morning included a letter from
his chief at Tucson. Marshall delivered a peremptory
mandate from Faraday. The borrow-pits and muck-ditches
were to be constructed according to precedent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
The stream-side excavating was to be continued. Marshall
added that this order admitted no argument.</p>

<p>Rickard, fuming helplessly, read the letter to MacLean,
Jr. “Everybody sticking his precious fingers in
the pie. Tying me up with orders. What does Faraday
know about it, I’d like to know?” MacLean observed a
Hardin inflection.</p>

<p>The mail had brought other exasperations. A classmate
he had been wiring for, an engineer specialist on
hydraulics, was ill. There was another letter from Marshall,
with enclosures. More complaints from Chicago.
Rickard declared he could “smell” Washington.</p>

<p>Irish brought the news of the Parrish horror. The
opened vein of tragedy stained the day. The double
tragedy, the three sharp deaths sobered the camp, preparing
for its coup.</p>

<p>“War!” summed up Rickard. “Our army marches
over dead bodies.”</p>

<p>The day badly begun, piled up with vexations. By
evening, Rickard’s temper, slow to rouse, was on the
rampage. His men got out of his way. The river flotsam
was piling up against the gate and making a kink in
the trestle. There was a nasty bend. Rickard spent his
afternoon on the by-pass, jumping from boats to rafts,
directing the pile-drivers, driving the stolid bucks. By
sundown, he was wet to the skin, and mad, he told MacLean,
Jr., as a sick Arizona cat.</p>

<p>In this jaundiced juncture, MacLean, Jr., brought
down his despatches to the river.</p>

<p>“Anything important?” cried Casey from the raft.
“Read them to me. I can hear.”</p>

<p>MacLean read of the burning of a trainload of railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
ties in a nasty wreck on the way to the break; just
out of Galveston. To purge his mood, Rickard swore.</p>

<p>“If that isn’t the darndest.” He had “luck” on his
tongue. His mood had been paralleling, disagreeably to
his consciousness, Tom Hardin’s manner. He withheld
the word.</p>

<p>“Anything else pleasant?”</p>

<p>“A letter from the governor—from dad. Nothing
important.” MacLean had that instant decided to leave
that letter on the desk where Rickard might find it by
himself.</p>

<p>“Fire away,” cried Rickard, stretching the cramp from
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Uncomfortably, MacLean cleared his throat before he
read that his father begged a small favor of Rickard.
“Godfrey, the celebrated English tenor, is on my hands.
His doctors have been advising outdoor occupation. I
am sending him to you, asking you to give him any job
you may have. He is willing to do anything. Put him
at something to keep him occupied.”</p>

<p>MacLean saw Rickard’s face turn red. “Suffering
cats! A worn-out opera-singer! What sort of an opera
does he think we’re giving down here? Why doesn’t he
send me a fur coat, or a pair of girl twins? Give the
tenor a rôle! Anything else? Pile it all on.”</p>

<p>“That’s all.” MacLean was turning away. Then, as
an afterthought, he threw over his shoulder, “Oh, and
one from Godfrey himself. He’s in Los Angeles. He
says he’ll be here to-morrow.” He did not wait for his
chief’s reply.</p>

<p>At the supper-table, Rickard, dry and in restored
humor, alluded to the invasion of high notes. “Pity the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
parts are all assigned! He might have done the ‘Toreador,’
or ‘Canio.’ The only vacancy—” he could safely
gibe at his own complications, for the Hardins were
dining on the <i>Delta</i> that evening, “is in the kitchen.
I wonder how he would like to be understudy to Ling!”</p>

<p>The next day when the incident had been forgotten,
and while Rickard was up at the Crossing on the concrete
gate, Godfrey blew into camp. He was like a boy
out on a lark. His brown eyes were dancing over the
adventure.</p>

<p>“He’s certainly not sick,” thought MacLean, Jr.
“Must be his throat.” He was a little piqued over
Rickard’s sarcasm. What in creation was his father
thinking about, anyway?</p>

<p>Godfrey asked to be turned loose. “I won’t be in
any one’s way!” He explored the Heading, covered the
by-pass in a river boat, went a way down the river, down
the old channel through which considerable water was
now flowing, made the trip down the levee work, on
horseback, and came back bubbling.</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest thing I ever saw. But say, Junior,
that’s what they call you, isn’t it? I’m the only idle man
here. Can’t you give me something to do?”</p>

<p>MacLean was not sure but that the suggestion of
Rickard’s had been a jest. He felt abashed to repeat it.
“I’ll do anything,” twinkled the handsome tenor. “I’d
like the boss to find me busy when he comes in.”</p>

<p>MacLean softened the offer. Perhaps until Mr. Godfrey
learned the ropes he could be of general use. They
were short-handed the present moment—there was another
hesitation—in the kitchen! Ling, the Chinese
cook, was overcrowded—so many visitors—</p>

<p>“Great,” crowed Godfrey, slapping him on the shoulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
“I don’t want to feel in the way. I want to earn
my board. And it’s not bad to keep on the right side of
the cook. No one can beat me beating eggs.”</p>

<p>His spirits were infectious. “Not many eggs in this
camp!” grinned MacLean.</p>

<p>“Lead me to the cook!” declaimed the newcomer.
“Chin chin Chinaman!” he sang at a daring pitch. “Chin
chin Chinaman, chop, chop, chop!” His voice had the
world-adored quality, the vibrant stirring thrill which
is never tremolo.</p>

<p>“He’ll do,” thought the youth. He foresaw concerts
on the deck of the <i>Delta</i>.</p>

<p>That evening, the dinner was helped on its way by the
best paid singer of England. In an apron, borrowed of
Ling, he was “having the time of his life.” Ling, pretending
to scold, had been won immediately. Rickard,
hearing of the jolly advent, forgot his vexation, and immediately
on his return made his way to the mesquit
enclosure—to greet the friend of George MacLean.</p>

<p>It was a comic opera already to Godfrey. He had
won over Ling by doing all of the tedious jobs. Had
peeled the potatoes, opened the cans of tomatoes, washed
the rice and scoured the pans. As Rickard, obscured
by the mesquit hedge, reached the enclosure, the newcomer
was entering by the riverside.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, you,” cried Ling. “Where you put my
potato skins? Save potato skins. Me plant skins by
liver, laise plenty potatoes—bimeby.”</p>

<p>Godfrey laughed uproariously. He pounced on a
red slab of bacon rind and was making for the outside,
Rickard vastly entertained.</p>

<p>“Hi, there,” yelled Ling. “Hi, stop. No thlow bacon
away. Save bacon. Me make hot cakes, grease pan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>“Not on your life,” Godfrey swept the irate Ling and
the entering stranger in khaki a deep theatric bow.
“Ling no get bacon. Me plant bacon by river. Me raise
hogs!”</p>

<p>Thus met Rickard and the tenor, who captured the
camp that night with his singing. After dinner, MacLean
carried off his prize to the <i>Delta</i>, where Godfrey
earned his welcome. In a dark corner, Brandon was
feeling the edge of his disappointment. George Verne
was blocking out a new book, so she had wired. She was
too busy to come. Gerty Hardin forgot to flirt with the
engineers; she had discovered a new sensation. The
wonderful voice twisted her heart-strings; it told her
that the heart that has truly loved never forgets, and she
knew that she could never have really loved, yet, because
the youth in her veins was whispering to her that she
could still forget. Godfrey saw a mobile plaintive face
turned up to the gibbous moon; he swept it with thrills
and flushes. She was a wonderful audience; she was
also his orchestra, the woman with the plaintive eyes.
He played on her expressions as though she were a harp.</p>

<p>Later, he was presented to Mrs. Hardin. She told
him that the camp would no longer be dull; that she had
tea every afternoon in her ramada. She convicted him
archly of British-hood. “She knew he must have his
tea!”</p>

<p>“You American women are the wonders of the world!
Nothing daunts you. In the desert, and you give afternoon
teas. I’ll be there every day!”</p>

<p>He gave her open admiration; she looked young and
wistful in her soft flowing mulls, the moonlight helping
her. She fell into a delicious flurry of nerves and excitement.
Later, she wandered with him from a rude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
gaping world into a heaven of silvered decks and gleaming
waters. He told her of himself, of his loneliness; his
music had dropped him to self-pity.</p>

<p>Gerty Hardin heard her bars drop behind her. She
snatched her first glimpse of freedom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>

<small>THE DRAGON SCORES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Palmyra</i> was once again on its siding. Marshall
was at the Front again; having made another
of his swift dashes from Tucson. This time he
expected officially to close the gate. Claudia was with
him. She never left the car, unless it were to step out
to the platform to see what she could from there of the
river work, immediately returning to her wool work in
the shaded compartment.</p>

<p>Hardin and Rickard had been devoting anxious weeks.
A heavy rainfall and cloudburst in the mountains of
northern Arizona had swollen the feeders of the Gila
River which roared down to the Colorado above Yuma.
The eroding streams carried mountains in solution which
settled against the gate, a scour starting above and below
it. Relief had to be given on the jump. A spur-track
was rushed across the by-pass above the gate, as the
closing of the ill-fated gate with the flash-boards was
no longer possible. A rock-fill was the only means of
closure. In the distant quarries men were digging out
rock to fill the call from the river.</p>

<p>Marshall came down to see the completed spur. Before
he reached the intake, the first rock train had moved
on to the spur-track. The trestle had settled, the train
thrown from the rails and wrecked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>“That’s not the way I planned to dump that rock!”
was Rickard’s comment. “Now, we’ll have to stop and
straighten out that trestle.”</p>

<p>“If we’d had those rock-aprons, this’d never have happened,”
stormed Hardin, who was standing on the bank
when the trestle gave way.</p>

<p>They were already repairing that disaster when the
<i>Palmyra</i> was cradled on its siding. Marshall from one
platform, Tony, white-capped from the rear, started
out for the river. Claudia settled herself for a quiet
morning.</p>

<p>When Innes Hardin came in later, she felt that she
was interrupting a fierce orgy. But Mrs. Marshall would
not let her go. “I can knit just as fast when I talk.”</p>

<p>The shades were all pulled down. To Innes’ protest,
her hostess declared that “she could see with her fingers.”
Innes had never asked the destiny of the little
knitted jackets; earlier in the acquaintance she had surmised
a pressing haste for some sister, or niece; a tender
date. She had seen several downy sacques completed;
but still those black needles clicked.</p>

<p>Later, Marshall came in from the damaged trestle,
bringing Rickard and Crothers. The chief was in buoyant
spirits, as though the accident had played to his hand,
instead of against it.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought company to lunch, mother,” his mellow
voice called through the car.</p>

<p>Only one caught the look of pain that twisted the
severe features of Claudia Marshall. Instantly, Innes
saw it disciplined into a welcoming smile. And then she
herself fell to flushing, and chilling, as a lithe-muscled
figure came directly to her. His eyes—where was the
look she had feared, of possessive tenderness? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
quizzical gleam was gone. On guard! A solemn business,
loving, when you know that it means—Life! On
guard, though, to <i>her</i>! She pulled her fingers from his
strong lingering clasp, and joined Mrs. Marshall, who
was again busily knitting, until Tony’s crisp whiteness
crackled into the apartment.</p>

<p>Rickard had his soldier look on. She was watching
him covertly as he talked with his host and Crothers,
as though she were not there; as though something were
not waiting for him to claim! She told herself that she
would have no character if she did not deny him, when
he came for her. How could he be talking, oblivious of
everything else in the world except that river? Was
that—loving? Could she think of anything else when
he was in the same room with her? Was that the difference
between men and women? Woman’s whole existence!
He was a soldier of the modern army. It came
to her, a sort of tender divination, that he would not
divide his thoughts, even with her, with Love, until his
battle was won. He owed his mind clear and on duty
to the work on hand. Well, couldn’t she understand
that? What her accusation against Gerty? Sex honor—keep
off the track! Wasn’t that her own notion?
Oughtn’t she to be proud of him?</p>

<p>She had brought a nest of waspish thoughts tumbling
about her ears. Gerty! He had loved Gerty. Her resentment
was alive again. Perhaps, it was not true.
Perhaps, some day he would tell her that it was not true,
had never been true. He couldn’t love her, if his thoughts
had ever lingered, with that same seriously solemn look
on the false little face of her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>A slur to a chef could one talk of else but food while
banqueting! Tony’s white cap danced around the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
after he had seated them, urging their appetites. Mrs.
Marshall tried to suppress him; Marshall and Rickard
wickedly abetting his capering. He forced a commendation
of his bouillon from dreamy Innes; the recipe, he
boasted, was his own. Tod Marshall’s query as to the
Spanish peppers evoked a long history. The lunch was
served to a running accompaniment of his reminiscences,
when he had been a restaurateur, and the great Samuel
Bliss one of his patrons. He was working up a crescendo
of courses. With the importance of a premier, he
bore in a majestic, seasoned plank carrying a thick steak.
Another trip to the kitchen returned a primrose sauce.</p>

<p>“Tony will be insulted if you do not all mention the
Bernaise,” Marshall had suggested during the chef’s
absence.</p>

<p>Rickard declared without straining his veracity that
it was the best Bernaise he had ever tasted. Tony’s face
worked with emotion.</p>

<p>“It is because no one knows how to mix a Bernaise—bah,
the bad stuff I’ve eaten! When I go to a big city,
I go to the finest hotel. Good clothes, a diamond ring,”
his finger shot up to his nose. “And who would refuse
to give me a table to myself? Who would believe that it
is a cook? I say, ‘Your best wine, and the steak thick,
and a sauce Bernaise!’ Never have I tasted it but once
fit to serve to a gentleman like Mr. Marshall—or Mr.
Bliss. They make it with poor vinegar. You can not
make the sauce Bernaise without the best Tarra-r-rragon
vinegar.” His r’s hurtled out like a burst of artillery.
“Everywhere you can not get the real Tar-r-ragon
vinegar. Ah!” His face grew wolfish and eager. “Tony
knows. Tony always carries it with him for the great
gentlemen like Mr. Bliss, Mr. Marshall—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“Some bread, Tony,” clipped in Mrs. Marshall. “You
can not teach him his place,” she complained in the interval,
“if you let him talk like this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you don’t want to, mother!”</p>

<p>Innes saw again the look of pain. Did he think her
life complete, in its guarding of his own reckless one!
Innes thought pitifully of the little knitted jackets.
Hadn’t he ever sensed—those?</p>

<p>Tony trotted back with the bread. He was eager with
speech, but Rickard was beginning a river anecdote, of
his introduction to Godfrey, the story of the bacon rind.
Marshall was at once interested in the tenor.</p>

<p>“We must have him down some night to sing for us,
eh, mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish he wouldn’t call her that!” yearned Innes.
A rich salad of mayonnaise and canned shrimps was
rejected, to the chef’s despair.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ll incapacitate us, Tony.” Marshall waved
it away. “I want to get back to Tucson alive. Now, a
cup of coffee, not another thing on your life—or I’ll cut
your salary. I want Mr. Rickard to do some work this
afternoon! Now be quick with the coffee.”</p>

<p>Deep gloom covered the retreat of the salad.</p>

<p>The coffee was brought in with ascetic simplicity. But
Tony was not to be crushed. While Marshall was talking
to Rickard, he insinuated a platter of cream puffs toward
the ladies.</p>

<p>Marshall caught the sly action. He stopped. “You
can have one—but only one, Rickard,” he commanded.
“If Tony does not mind me, you must.”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me,” Rickard was rising. “Tony,
will you <i>owe</i> it to me? There really is other work to be
done to-day. You are setting a bad example in camp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
Mr. Marshall, you and Tony. We are not sybarites
here.” His good-by to Innes was guarded. Why should
she drop her eyes, she asked herself angrily? Nothing
there that the whole world might not see! Marshall
went out to the platform with his engineer. Immediately
he came back, smiling, “Look here, girls!”</p>

<p>Claudia and Innes Hardin followed him to the platform.
Under the kitchen window, a group of young
engineers were eating indiscriminate “hand-outs.” MacLean,
unabashed, waved a lukewarm stuffed pepper at
his chief. Bodefeldt, caught red-handed, crimsoned
under his desert tan when Innes’ glance isolated him,
his mouth full of cream puffs, his hand greasy from fried
bananas.</p>

<p>“He’s a prince,” cried Bangs, of the Reclamation
Service.</p>

<p>“He can afford to be on that salary,” cried MacLean,
with roguish intention. “I’d be generous on a hundred
and fifty a month.”</p>

<p>“Mex.,” cried Bangs. “That’s only seventy-five.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hundred and fifty,” spluttered the white cap
from the window. “I spend it in Mexico; I get twice as
much for a dollar down there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let them tease you, Tony,” laughed Marshall.
“You’ll spend that hundred and fifty in Mexico next
week.”</p>

<p>They were standing in the shade of the <i>Palmyra</i>,
Claudia on the platform shading her eyes, Innes on the
step below. It was a soft still afternoon. There was
no wind; not a cloud blurred the sky. The burning heat
of summer had passed, giving place to a warmth that was
like a caress. The fierceness of the savage desert had
melted to her days of lure. Beyond, the turbid waters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
of the Colorado bore a smiling surface. There was
nothing to hint of treachery.</p>

<p>It was a minute of pleasant lassitude, snatched from
the turmoil. Rickard had succumbed to the softness of
the day and his mood. He was enjoying the thought of
Innes’ nearness, though she kept her face turned from
him. He knew by the persistence of those averted eyes
that she was as acutely conscious of his presence as he
was, restfully, of hers. Deliberately, he was prolonging
the instant.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Marshall. The group moved. Rickard
turned toward his hostess. Just then a strange thing
happened. A stir on the river had caught the alert eye
of Tod Marshall. He swore a string of picturesque Marshallian
oaths. Rickard’s eyes jumped toward the by-pass.
The placid waters had suddenly buckled. Majestically,
the gate rose and went out. They watched it
variously, the groups by the <i>Palmyra</i>; the catastrophe
too big for speech. Months of work swept away! The
gate drifted a hundred feet or more, then stopped as
though sentience, or a planned terminal, were governing
its motion. Some unseen obstruction caught it there, to
mock at the labors of man.</p>

<p>Innes, aghast, had turned toward Rickard. His face
was expressionless. There was a babel of excited voices
behind them, Bodefeldt, MacLean, Tony, Crothers,
Bangs, all talking at once. Her eyes demanded something
of Rickard. A fierce resentment rose against his
calmness. “He knew it,” she rebelled. “He’s been expecting
this to happen. It’s no tragedy to <i>him</i>!” There
was a stab as of physical pain; she was visualizing the
blow to Tom.</p>

<p>She heard Marshall’s voice, speaking to Rickard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
“Well, you’re ready for this.” She did not hear the
answer, for already Rickard was heading for the by-pass.
Marshall and the young engineers followed him.
The women were left staring. An odd sound came from
the rear of the car.</p>

<p>“What is that?” demanded Claudia.</p>

<p>They found Coronel sitting on the ground, his knees
drawn up to his chin. His mud-crusted head was turned
riverward. His age-curdled eyes, fixed on the spot
where the gate had been, did not see them. A moaning
issued from his shut lips. His paint-striped shoulders
were shaking with dry sobs. He had been watching,
waiting for fifteen years. It was all over, now, to him.
The Great Dragon had conquered.</p>

<p>Innes moved toward him. Coronel cared, Coronel and
Tom! The Indian sat, wrapped in his grief. To the
girl the worst, too, had happened. She had refused to
believe in the possibility of failure. Her brother’s optimism
had swept her along. That wreck down yonder
was worse than failure; it was ruin. It involved Tom’s
life. It was his life. This would be the final crushing
of his superb courage—her thoughts released from their
paralysis were whipped by sudden fear. She must find
him, be with him. She did not see the look of sympathy
on Claudia Marshall’s face. She felt alone, with Coronel.
The next instant, she was speeding like a young
colt toward the encampment.</p>

<p>Estrada met her on the run. “Have you heard?” she
cried. Estrada said he had just been talking to Rickard.
He looked sorry, she reflected after she left him,
sorry for her; but not surprised. “No one is surprised
but Coronel, Coronel and I.”</p>

<p>Had Gerty heard? The pity that she must know! She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
would not be tender to Tom; her pride would be
wounded. She must ask her to be tender, generous. Her
footsteps slackened as she came in sight of the tents.</p>

<p>She heard voices in the ramada, a man’s clear notes
mingling with Gerty’s childish treble. “Godfrey!” Her
mind jumped to other tête-à-têtes. Of course! Abundant
opportunity, with herself and Tom at the break all
day! So that was what was going on. And she not
seeing! Just a cheap little woman! If not one man,
then another! Conquests, attention! Horrid little clandestine
affairs!</p>

<p>The meeting was awkward. Speedily, Innes got rid
of the news. She caught an odd look glittering in Mrs.
Hardin’s eyes. The same expression Rickard had worn
when the gate went out! As though his slate had been
cleared, as though her sister-in-law saw an obstacle drop
from her path.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardin shrugged. Her shrugs were dainty, not
the hunching variety. She merely moved her shoulders,
the action as elusive as a twinkle.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll go out.” Plaintively, she made the announcement
as though it were just evolved. “Now, the
camp will be horrid. Everybody will be cross, and everybody
will be working. Perspiring men are not inspiring
men!”</p>

<p>As she left the tent beyond, Innes could hear the vibrant
voice of Godfrey persuading Mrs. Hardin to stay
there a few weeks longer. She could hear him say, “This
will delay the turning of the river at the most but a few
weeks. Rickard told me so a week ago. And think what
it would be here without you!”</p>

<p>“They were all expecting it!” resisted Innes Hardin.
She turned back toward the river. She must find Tom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII<br>

<small>A SUNDAY SPECTACLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TROUBLE with the tribes, innocent and childish in
its first aspect, was well grown before it was recognized.
Disaffection was ripe, the bucks were heady,
the white man’s silver acting like wine. Few of the
braves had dreamed of ever possessing sums of money
such as they drew down each Sunday morning. They
were paid a white man’s wage, and to each group of ten
went another man’s pay, “<i>lagniappe</i>,” to be paid to a
squaw cook for the squad. The extra sum had excited
from the first a gentle insurrection. Had they dared,
they would have divided it among themselves, but the
obloquy of “squaw man” confronted them. The discussion
was weekly; over their pipes and their fires that
sum was passed, itching their palms.</p>

<p>It was a solemn processional, smacking of ceremonial,
which filed into Rickard’s ramada every Sunday. Pay
time was the climax of their week, the symbol of the
revel which followed. All day, the bucks danced and
glutted.</p>

<p>Rickard began to suspect liquor again. The commandant
and Forestier protested. There was no way of
their getting liquor. Still Rickard shrugged, incredulous.
In the Indian camp, Sunday was a day of feasting, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
by a gorged sleep; the next day, one of languor,
of growing incohesion.</p>

<p>Rickard spoke of it to Coronel who was his “go-between,”
as MacLean, Jr., dubbed him, a valuable interpreter,
because he transcribed the spirit of an interview.
Coronel’s patois, mongrel and pantomimic, was current
coin among all the tribes.</p>

<p>“Like small baby,” hunched the old shoulders. “Happy
baby. Pretty soon stop.”</p>

<p>With the next wages went a reprimand, then a warning.
Still followed bad Mondays. It was easy to see
that no work was to be expected from them on that day,
their all-night feasting insufficiently slept off. Rickard
then issued a formal warning to all the tribes.</p>

<p>The white men were being held antithetically by their
habits of carousal; Rickard, doling out the weekly wage,
had been observing the pitiable look of determination on
the faces of the volatile hobo. “The look of ‘I can bear
no more; I shall move on.’”</p>

<p>“Poor devils!” he exclaimed to MacLean as Number
Ten, the hobo without a name, shuffled out, bearing his
money in his hand and a farewell leer on his face. His
number, bound by a circle, his mark and title, decorated
each bridge and pier, so his boast ran, between New Orleans
and San Francisco, and then again, New York.
He was on his second round, and he had never bought a
ticket in his life.</p>

<p>“Poor devils,” he repeated as the desert’s perspective
claimed the tramp. “They always think that they are
not coming back. It’s a mean trick we play on them.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trick?” queried MacLean absently, who
was thinking of Innes Hardin. He had seen her on the
river with his chief the evening before; and the flash of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
betrayal from the eyes of Rickard, the girl’s shy
quenched gleam of surrender, had been a shock to him.
Until that instant, he had thought she lined up with the
rest of the Hardins in hating Rickard. So that was what
had been going on under his nose! It looked settled to
him; he would not have believed that no word had been
spoken.</p>

<p>He had wondered since what variety of fool he had
been making of himself. Trying to oust a man like
Rickard—a <i>man</i>. That was the particular sting. He
was reproaching himself for bloodlessness as he counted
out moneys for his chief that afternoon. Surely, had he
any spirit, his disappointment would have flared into
bitter enmity against the man who had stolen what he
was coveting. For Innes Hardin was a queen! He had
never seen any one like her. Queer, he could not make
himself hate Rickard. Something must be wrong with
himself, to be able to sit there in the old familiar way,
without bitterness in his heart.</p>

<p>“They think they are free men; free to go and come.
And we own them, body and soul. They might as well
be slaves for all they can do.”</p>

<p>MacLean frowned. “I don’t think I understand.” He
put aside his problem for a while. He would settle that
later.</p>

<p>“Lord! MacLean, didn’t you see ‘Ten’s’ face?”</p>

<p>Dimly, MacLean summoned a gaunt heat-seared visage;
an unshaven, stubbled face of leering defiance. “He
won’t come back again.”</p>

<p>“But he will. He’s got to come back. He can’t get
through Yuma. That’s the trick. We have the screw on
them. Yuma’s practised. She won’t let a man with a
week’s wages in his pockets slip through her talons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
They all mean to go. Lord! I see it in each of their
faces as they come in here. As I pay them off, their
eyes say: ‘I’ve got enough to be quit of you with your
hell-hole. You can go to the devil for all the work you’ll
get out of me.’ They don’t say it because they’re afraid,
not of me, but of Yuma. They’re afraid of Yuma. And
when she’s sucked them dry, they slink back here for one
more week of it.”</p>

<p>MacLean drew in his lip, frowning at the memory of
the stubbled face as it had glared at Rickard.</p>

<p>“You remember Jack, the hobo?”</p>

<p>“Arnica Jack?” In spite of his resolution to be miserable,
MacLean laughed. The hobo’s weak ever-turning
ankles made him the butt of the hobo camp. A bottle of
arnica in his coat pocket, the insidious smell of the stuff
which clung to his clothes, had drawn the inevitable sobriquet.</p>

<p>“He didn’t come in to-day. Poor devil! He’s trying
to stick it out, and not draw his wages. You run a
chance of being put off in the heart of the desert when
you ride out on a brake-beam from Yuma. You’ve got
to have a little ‘dough’ in your pocket to wheedle a man
with a team, or a soft-hearted brakeman. Else it’s death.
We’ve got it on them, a dead sure cinch.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t I seen any of this?” demanded MacLean,
sitting up, very red.</p>

<p>“It’s not on the surface. They go out swaggering
Sunday; they come back cringing Monday. That’s all
there is to it. But the situation with the Indians is more
serious. They’re getting liquor in here, some way, the
Lord only knows how. Maybe Coronel is right; he declares
they are simply gorged with food, dead from their
stuffed orgies. Anyway, they’re not fit for burning Monday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
morning. I’ve just sent them word by Coronel that
it’s got to quit, or they do.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they do?” MacLean was startled. Not an
Indian could be spared at that stage of the game.</p>

<p>“Bluff!” Rickard got up. “It’s caught white men before
this. They won’t take the chance of losing that
money. I’m off now to the Crossing. There’s a hitch
at the concrete gate. I’ll be back this afternoon. I’ll
leave you in charge here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hold down your seat.” He did not remember his
lagging enmity until Rickard’s dancing step had carried
him out of sight. MacLean spent an hour unraveling
the puzzle of it. If a man really loves a woman,—his
question hurled a doubt at the integrity of his affection.
Stoutly, he defended that. Yet, he should hate Rickard.
His veins must run ice-water. An Ogilvie sort of man he
was!</p>

<p>The next morning, Wooster broke into the ramada
where MacLean sat clicking his typewriter.</p>

<p>“Where’s Casey?”</p>

<p>“Gone to the Crossing. Anything up?”</p>

<p>“Everything’s up.” Wooster flung his hat on the table.
He stood, legs wide apart, his hands thrust into his
pockets, looking down on Rickard’s secretary. “He’s
done it now. Sent some all-fired, independent kindergarten
orders to the Indians. Says they have to be in
bed by ten o’clock, or some such hour on Saturday and
Sunday nights. Indians won’t stand that! Any tenderfoot
ought to know that. At this stage of the game,
when we can’t afford to lose a man. It’s a strike, their
answer. That’s what his monkeying has brought down
on us.”</p>

<p>“They’re not going to quit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>“They’ve sent word they won’t work on Mondays,
and they will go to bed when they choose Saturday
night. Losing one day a week! We can’t stand for
that.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad.” MacLean was relieved. “I
thought they were all going. He’ll find a way out.”
He remembered then that he was speaking of his rival.
This was an opportunity to put him in the wrong. Instead
he was flaming to partisanship. No backbone!
He found himself taking the side of the man he should
be hating. “He’s no man’s goat.” Only sense of justice,
this!</p>

<p>“Luck’s been playing into his hands,” spat Wooster.
“But this will show him up. This’ll show Marshall his
pet clerk. Tell Casey there’ll be no Indians to-morrow.”
He sputtered angrily out of the office.</p>

<p>Rickard seemed pleased when MacLean made the announcement
a few hours later. “Good! Now, we
have something to work on.”</p>

<p>“You are losing the work of five hundred men for one
day a week,” urged MacLean, observing him as curiously
as though he were a stranger.</p>

<p>“We had already lost them. They have not given us
a day’s work on Mondays for weeks past, and we’ve had
to give them a full week’s pay. You can’t deduct for
lazy work, not unless you’ve an overseer for each man.”
His secretary was weighing him. “What do you intend
to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Call their bluff,” grinned Casey, showing teeth tobacco
had not had a chance to spoil. “Boycott them.”
He was at his table, already, writing. He had forgotten
to remove his duster or his hat. He was unconscious
of his secretary’s new appraisement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>“But you can’t afford to take the chance—” began
MacLean, forcing a tepid hostility.</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t I?” His tone suggested, “You’re playing
on the track, kid.”</p>

<p>Reddening, the boy persisted. “But the others—the
engineers, <i>can</i> you afford to? Suppose you lose?”</p>

<p>Rickard threw down his pen. “I’ve got to have workers,
not dabbers! If I’m to lose the Indians, the sooner
I know it the better. I don’t want to know what the
others think. I’ve got to go straight ahead. Don’t
think I’ve not seen their faces. Take this note to Wooster.
Tell him to take Coronel and see Forestier.”</p>

<p>On his way, MacLean felt like the match that is to
set off a charge of dynamite. Wooster would go straight
up in the air. Those Hardin men would make an uproar
that would be heard at Yuma!</p>

<p>He found Wooster at the river-bank, with Tom Hardin.
The two men were watching a pile-driver set a
rebellious pile for the new trestles. Two new trestles
were to supplement the one which had been bent out of
line by the weight of settling drift. The pile-driver had
no Sabbath, now. The piles must be placed before rock
could be poured between. Marshall’s plan was being
followed, though jeered at by Reclamation men and the
engineers of the D. R. Company.</p>

<p>“Stop the mattress weaving and dump like hell!” had
been his orders.</p>

<p>No one believed that the soft silt bottom of the river
which cut out like salt would hold a pour of rock. Marshall,
aided by Rickard, schemed to fight power with
haste. Faster than the current could wash it down-stream,
the crews would rain gravel and rock on to the
treacherous river-bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>“And there’s always the concrete gate when everything
else fails,” Marshall was fond of repeating when
he saw polite incredulity in opposing faces.</p>

<p>“Boycott the Indians, well, I’m blowed,” the beady
eyes sparked at Hardin. “Now, he’s cut his own throat.”</p>

<p>“By the eternal!” swore Hardin. MacLean left the
two engineers matching oaths. “If he wins out on this!”
he was speculating as he made his way back to his copying,
“I’ll back him against anything. Wonder how he
feels, inside, about it? I know just how I’d feel. Scared
stiff.”</p>

<p>There was an ominous quiet the next day. Not an
Indian offered to work at the river. A few stolid bucks
came to their tasks on Tuesday morning; they were
told by Rickard himself that there was no work for
them. Rickard appeared ignorant of the antagonism of
the engineers.</p>

<p>Wooster watched the Yumas carry their stormy faces
back to their camp.</p>

<p>“Garl darn it,” he cried. “There’s his chance, and
he lost it.”</p>

<p>An unfathered rumor started that Rickard was in with
the Reclamation Service men; that he wanted the work
to fail; to be adopted by the Service. MacLean broke
a lance or two against the absurd slander. He was making
the discovery that a man’s friendship for a man may
be deeper than a man’s love for a woman. It was upsetting
all his preconceived notions. He was backing his
hot young will for Rickard to win out. He got to blow-point
that evening with Bodefeldt. He avoided Wooster
and Silent and Hardin. It inflamed his boyish loyalty
to find that he was losing his old friendships. He was
a Rickard man. He was made to feel the reproach of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>Wednesday dawned dully. Not an Indian reported.
Squatting in their camp, they listened to “Fig Tree Jim”
and Joe Apache, the insurgent bucks. Coronel passed
from camp to camp, his advice unpopular. “They would
get their pay, and stay out Monday beside. Joe Apache
said so.”</p>

<p>Scouts sent out to watch the work on the river reported
it was crippled. The white man would be sending
for the Indian soon. The waiting braves sat on their
haunches, grinning and smoking their pipes.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Forestier, who must feed his reservation
Indians while away from the reservation, grew
anxious. He tried arguments with the Indians; then
with Rickard. That engineer had just been closeted with
Marshall who was taking a swift run out to Tucson that
day. Rickard would not budge from his position. The
Indians must work Monday, or not at all. He refused
to discuss the situation with Forestier, or any one. He
was apparently engrossed with the setting of the piles.
That the brush-cutting was held up, the work on the
levee halted, he waived as unimportant. The look of
the Hardin faction was getting on his nerves; he was
learning to swear and smile at the same time.</p>

<p>Marshall carried a worried face from the Heading.
He must back his man in this! And he never forgot the
levee. Still, if he should fail— He determined to
arrange to pull some track crews from Salton and the
West Coast to send to Rickard for emergency.</p>

<p>Saturday night, the camp went gloomily to bed. On
the Indian side, there was no revel, no feasting or dancing.
Forestier was closeted with Rickard.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take them back to their reservations,”
he said. “I can’t keep them here, we can’t afford to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
They’ve got to be fed. You know, Rickard, the howl
that’d be raised if the thing gets out twisted. Sentimental,
the Indian feeling is, you and I know that, but
it’d be uncomfortable. The man who’d kick an Indian
out of his back yard would go to Washington to start
up a scandal if any blamed buck says he was starving.”</p>

<p>“Hold them here a few days, you can,” Rickard was
worried, himself. Forestier could not keep them out of
their reservations if they were not earning money. He
knew that. Already, he was needing them badly at the
river. Something, will or reason, he was not sure, would
not let him give in.</p>

<p>“Just two or three days,” he urged Forestier.</p>

<p>“I’ll try.” The face of the Indian agent was not reassuring.
Rickard did not turn in until after midnight,
planning alternatives. He was sleeping hard when MacLean,
at dawn, dashed into his tent.</p>

<p>“Quick, what does this mean?”</p>

<p>Rickard was scrambling into his clothes. It was the
river, of course. The trestles had been carried out? He
was into his khaki trousers and slippers. He made a
dive into his shirt as he followed MacLean to the tent
door, his head working through the bag of cloth to the
light-well at the top.</p>

<p>“Look over there,” cried MacLean. “What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>It was a splendid spectacle, and staged superbly. For
background, the sharp-edged mountains flushing to pinks
and purples against a one-hued sky; the river-growth
of the old channel uniting them, blotting out miles of
desert, into a flat scene. On the opposite bank of the
New River, five hundred strong, lined up formidably,
their faces grotesque and ferocious with paint, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
seven tribes. The sun’s rays glinted up from their fire-arms,
shot-guns, revolvers, into a motley of defiance!
Cocopahs, with streaming hair, blanketed Navajos,
short-haired Pimas, those in front reining in their silent
pinto ponies, and all motionless, silent in that early
morning light.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” whispered MacLean. Rickard
did not answer. He had one nauseous instant, as he
looked toward Innes’ tent. Then he noticed a movement
in the throng; he saw it was the pressing of newcomers
toward the front of the brilliant mass. Brown naked
chests gleamed with wet paint. Black shirts, striped
with white and yellow and red, made a strange serpent
effect. Ropes of beads weighted down their shoulders;
ribbons streamed from their arms.</p>

<p>The barbaric spectacle stood immovable. The stir
came from the near bank. The camp was rising. From
each tent, a face thrust out casually, stayed to watch,
startled. The unsettled condition of the days past had
prepared the stage for some climax; the surprise loomed
savage and threatening.</p>

<p>MacLean was watching Rickard’s face. The manager
had drawn back into the shadow of his tent. He expected
to see them wheel and ride out of camp; this
then their ultimatum. He did not fear worse trouble,
now that nauseous half-second was over; they had too
much to lose; there was no one to organize, to mobilize.
Still, they were Indians—he was trying to make out
their faces; the whites, surprised—the squads divided,
at the levee, up at the Crossing!</p>

<p>MacLean had turned to watch the Indians; he heard
a chuckle. Rickard broke into laughter.</p>

<p>“See, the white horse, no, in front—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>“By jove,” MacLean slapped his thigh. “Coronel!
They had me buffaloed. What do you think it is?”</p>

<p>Rickard stepped out into the wash of morning air,
and waved a solemn salute across the river. Gravely,
it was returned by Coronel.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” demanded MacLean.</p>

<p>“It means we’ve won,” chuckled his chief, coming
back into his tent.</p>

<p>“If you haven’t the best—luck,” substituted MacLean,
self-consciously.</p>

<p>“If you say ‘luck’ to me,” grinned Rickard, “I’ll cane
you! Get out, I want my shower. They’ll be coming
over here now.”</p>

<p>An hour later, after every one in camp had looked
and speculated and smiled, the first thrill passed, at the
massed Indians, Coronel led in a picked group of the
tribes. If the white chief would recall the boycott, the
Monday strike was over. The white man’s silver had
won.</p>

<p>Rickard shook hands all around, and commended
Coronel privately. “You’ll get a present for this.” The
wrinkled face was majestically inscrutable.</p>

<p>“They could never do it like white men,” commented
Rickard after they had left the ramada. “They must
get up that bit of bravado; they are like children—”
He never finished his sentence. He was thinking of a
little white tent, and an instant of nausea when he had
first seen those waiting Indians.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>

<small>THE WHITE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“LORD, I’m tired,” groaned Rickard, stumbling into
camp, wet to the skin. “Don’t you say letters to
me, Mac. I’m going to bed. Tell Ling I don’t want any
dinner. He’ll want to fuss up something. I don’t want
to see food.”</p>

<p>As he moved on to his tent, MacLean noted a dragging
step and a feverish face. But his anxiety was dwarfed
by Ling’s. The Chinese immediately invaded Rickard’s
tent, leaving the dishing of the dinner to Godfrey. Ling
found Rickard, burning with fever, stripping for a cold
shower.</p>

<p>“Velly bad, velly bad,” he exclaimed. “Hi, there, you
stop,” as Rickard went on stripping. “Hi, there, no
cold watel. Me ketchem hot watel.”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Hot</i> watel’! I’m burning up now!”</p>

<p>“Here you, get into bed, hop. I ketchem warm watel.
Cold watel no good, make velly sick. Hop.”</p>

<p>Rickard hopped. He was worn to the point of yielding
to any authoritative voice. The day had been exhausting.
His eyes closed with weariness. He did not
watch Ling’s new captaincy. The Chinese, soft-slippered,
pattered around the tent, and out. The sheets
felt cool and comfortable. Rickard had a sensation of
dropping, falling into oblivion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>The day, confused and jumbled, burned across his
eyeballs; a turmoil of bustle and hurry of insurrection.
He had made a swift stand against that. He was to
be minded to the last man-jack of them, or any one
would go, his threat including the engineers, Silent,
Irish, Wooster, Hardin himself. This was no time for
factions, for leader feeling. They knew he meant business;
perhaps the tussle with the Indians had had good
effect. But he had lost his temper with Hardin and
Wooster; he didn’t feel pleased with himself. It left a
sting of self-discontent which pulled him back from the
rest into which he was sinking. A man can enjoy the
mastery over other men if he gets out of it with self-control.
It seemed worse now than when he had been
in the clamor and the contention of the day. Tossing
feverishly on his bed, the day’s perspective gave no order,
no progress. His body was hot, his head on fire.</p>

<p>His grouch focused on Wooster. “The gall of him!”
He recalled the snapping black beads of eyes as they
resented Rickard’s criticism of his handling of the rock.</p>

<p>“Who’s superintendent here?” had growled Wooster.</p>

<p>“It is a pity that I must superintend your superintending,”
had been his answer. “You will obey my
orders, or quit.”</p>

<p>“He’s had an ax for me ever since I came; he’s been
sore ever since I won over the Indians. He thought
he was going to see me crushed. The whole camp would
have crowed had those Indians marched out. Lord,
what a head I have!”</p>

<p>Ling came in, towing a portable tub of galvanized tin,
a bucket of steaming water in his other hand.</p>

<p>“If you think you’re going to get me into that, you’re
mistaken,” Rickard raised his head to scowl at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
bucket. Ling had the tact not to answer. Quiet as a
cat, he placed the tub by the bedside, and emptied the
bucket. Pattering to the door, he took from an unseen
waiting hand, another pail of rising steam, and a large
yellow-papered tin of mustard.</p>

<p>“You needn’t think you’re going to boss me,” Rickard
flared with impotent resistance. “Mustard! I’ve not
taken that since I was a small boy. I’m not going to
put my foot in it, do you hear?”</p>

<p>Ling would not hear. He was moving noiselessly
around the tent, blind and deaf to scowls and grumbling.
Rickard watched him collect blankets and towels. His
rebellion was deflected. What an amusing race it was,
at cooking, nursing or diplomacy equally facile!</p>

<p>“Who was that outside the door?” The hand suddenly
reassured to him.</p>

<p>“Mlister Godfley.” Ling, the laconic, went on with
his preparations. When he had finished, he stopped
suddenly in front of the bed. Rickard was off guard.</p>

<p>“Here you, ketchem bath. Hop.”</p>

<p>“A bath, get in that? Not on your life,” defied Rickard.
But he knew he was as putty in Ling’s hands.</p>

<p>“Hop, velly quick,” commanded Ling.</p>

<p>As Rickard did not hop, he was pulled out of bed
by soft Chinese, work-wrinkled fingers. After a sputtering
resistance to the sting of the hot mustard, he lay
back, an unexpected relaxation meeting his supineness.
The first sting over, the pain began to melt from his
bones, from his strained aching muscles. His irritability
began to dissolve. He decided to forgive Ling, who
had left the tent.</p>

<p>His eyes closed. He caught an instant’s doze. Ling’s
entrance wakened him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>“This salad water’s all right! I’m going to stay here
all night.”</p>

<p>The Chinese had a hot, pungent smelling drink in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, say,” groaned the engineer. “I don’t have to
drink that!”</p>

<p>“All lite tamale,” replied the calm doctor. “Hi, there,
get up. Hop. Pletty quick. Take heap cold. Velly
bad.”</p>

<p>In bed, Ling’s hot drink inside him, the day with its
irritations fell away. He could see now the step ahead
that had been taken; the last trestle was done; the rock-pouring
well on; he called that going some! He felt
pleasantly languid, but not yet sleepy. His thought
wandered over the resting camp. The <i>Delta</i> was no
longer entertaining; the days were too strenuous for
that. Frank Godfrey must be finding them dull. And
then Innes Hardin came to him.</p>

<p>Not herself, but as a soft little thought which came
creeping around the corner of his dreams. She had
been there, of course, all day, tucked away in his mind,
as though in his home waiting for him to come back to
her, weary from the pricks of the day. The way he
would come home to her, please God, some day. Not
bearing his burdens to her, he did not believe in that,
but asking her diversions. Perhaps she would sing to
him, or play to him, little tender tunes he could understand.
He had never had time to keep up with the new-fangled
music which sounded to his ear like a distinct
endeavor to be unmusical and bizarre. All the melodies
have been used up; Mozart and those old boys had
hogged them. The moderns have had to invent a school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
of odd discords and queer rhythms. Innes would tell
him about that! Some day! Contentment spread her
soft wings over him. When Ling came stealing back,
his patient was asleep.</p>

<p>The tent was a wash of white light when he woke;
the moon was filtering through the white canvas; a band
of pale radiance was streaming through the screen door.
Rickard wakened as to a call. What had startled him?
He had been sleeping heavily, the deep sleep that knows
no dreaming. He listened, raising himself by his elbow.
From a distance, a sweet high voice, unreal in its pitch
and thrilling quality, came to him. It pieced on to his
last waking thought. For an instant, he thought it was
Innes.</p>

<p>Awake, the rhythmic beat coming clear and sweet to
him, he knew it was Godfrey; Godfrey, somewhere on
the levee, singing by the river.</p>

<p>“What a voice that fellow has!” He wondered what
it was he was singing. “The quality of the angels, and
the lure of the sirens besides!”</p>

<p>There was a haunting thrill to the air; something he
should remember. He used to be able to carry tunes;
was it too late, he wondered, to sharpen his musical
memory? The soft side of life he had left alone, music,
ease, poetry; they went with women, and his swift
marching life had had no time for them. Women and
little children. Was it too late to begin? Had he worked
too long to learn to play? What was that tune Godfrey
was singing now? He knew that; it was about the age
of seventeen. It brought him again to Innes Hardin.
He pulled aside his curtain which hung over the screening
of his tent and looked out into a moon-flooded world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
The stars were dimmed, thrust into their real distances
by the world’s white courier. Rickard’s eyes fell on a
little tent over yonder, a white shrine. “White as that
fine sweet soul of hers!”</p>

<p>Wandering into the night, Godfrey passed down the
river, singing alone. His voice, the footlights, the listening
great audiences were calling to him. To him, the
moon-flooded levee, the glistening water, made a star-set
scene. He was treading the boards, the rushing
waters by the bank gave the orchestration for his melody—<i>La
Donna è Mobile</i>. He began it to Gerty Hardin;
she would hear it in her tent; she would take it as
the tender reproach he had teased her with that afternoon
in the ramada.</p>

<p>He forgot her as he sang, the footlights, the great
audiences claiming him. They called him back! “<i>Bis!
bis!</i>” He gave it again. Still, they called for him. He
must come back! He gave them for encore a ballad
long forgotten; he had pulled it back from the cobwebs
of two decades; he had made it his own; reviving it to
a larger popularity; they were selling records of it now
on Broadway. In South America, in Mexico, in lonely
ranches, distant barrancas, the far-spread audiences
listened to his imprisoned voice, by modern magic released
to them.</p>

<p>Detached, as an observer he worshiped his wonderful
gift; impersonally, it was guarded; he could speak
of it without vanity. Pity, the fellow who wrote the
simple air was dead; it was enriching publishers; those
“canned music people!”</p>

<p>The audience, South American, English, Mexican, was
calling. Australia, now, was clapping her hands. That
last verse again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“But, my darling, you will be,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever young and fair to me.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The hush, that wonderful hush which always greets
that ballad, falls on the house again.</p>

<p>It came, the soaring voice, to Tom Hardin, outside
Gerty’s tent on his lonely cot. He knew that song. He
had shouted it with the fellows at college, passing
through the Lawrence streets at night. The words came
running back to meet him. “Woman is changeable.” Had
he sensed the words then? “Woman is changeable.”
All of them then, not alone Gerty. For she had loved
him once, he had seen her face flushing answer into his.
Changed altogether, the changeable. Disdained by his
wife, a pretty figure a man cuts! If his wife can’t stand
him, who can? He wasn’t good enough for her. He
was rough. His life had kept him from fitting himself
to her taste. She needed people who could talk like
Rickard, sing like Godfrey. People, other people, might
misconstrue her preferences. He knew they were not
flirtations; she needed her kind. She would always keep
straight; she was straight as a whip. Life was as hard
for her as it was for him; he could feel sorry for her;
his pity was divided between the two of them, the husband,
the wife, both lonely in their own way.</p>

<p>Then his bitterness softened to the new air Godfrey
was singing. He could hear his mother’s voice humming
it over her task in her rough pioneer kitchen. He lay
quite still listening, life crowding before his open eyes.
No use coaxing sleep, with the moon making day of the
night. His memory was a harp, and Godfrey was plucking
at the strings.</p>

<p>On the other side of the canvas walls, Gerty Hardin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
lay listening to the message meant for her. The fickle
sex, he had called hers; no constancy in woman, he had
declared, fondling her hair. He had tried to coax her
into pledges, pledges which were also disavowals to the
man outside.</p>

<p><i>Silver threads!</i> Age shuddered at her threshold.
She would not get old, oh, why would he not sing something
else? She hated that song. Cruel, life had been
to her, none of its promises had been kept. To be happy,
why, that was a human’s birthright; grab it, that was
her creed! Before you get old, before the pretty face
wrinkles, and men forget to look at you with the worship
beauty brings. She wanted to die before that
happened—she would push age away from her—she
could. But before that awful time which offered no
alleviation, she must be happy, she must taste of success,
hear the plaudits of the crowd left behind. When God
made the world, He did not make enough happiness to
go around; one must snatch it as it passed. There was
a chance yet; youth had not gone. He was singing it
to her, her escape—</p>

<p>It was not true. The song was a lie. He would not
love her when she was old. Men don’t. They want
roses and bright eyes, youth. Cruel, men are. But she
had a few years yet. She would live those years, not
spend them with regrets.</p>

<p>She had a wild thought of running out to him, to cry
her joy, her bitterness in his arms! He was waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
for her, hoping for her down by the levee; his love was
like a schoolboy’s in its eagerness. But the sulky figure
of Tom guarded her door. Tom was like Innes, always
watching her with distrust, suspicion in his eyes. Whatever
she would do, they would have driven her to it.
She was going to be happy—to be happy before she was
old!</p>

<p>Godfrey, singing to Gerty Hardin, had awakened the
camp. Once roused, the brilliant night made sleep impossible.
Innes, in her tent, too, was listening. Once,
in her childhood, she had wakened to the sound of near
music, sweet, unearthly, in its soaring lightness, now
antiphonal, now in unison. To-night, so Godfrey’s song
pierced her dreams, and brought back that unreal childish
night, another white night such as this. She opened
her curtain to the wide spread of silvered desert; the
moonlight streamed in on her bed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Darling, you will be,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever young and fair to me!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>So that is the miracle, that wild rush of certain feeling!
Yesterday, doubting, to-morrow, more doubts—but
to-night, the song, the night isolated them, herself
and Rickard, into a world of their own. To-night, it
did not even pain her that he had been the lover of Gerty
Hardin, faithful through years, as Gerty had hinted, to
a love that was not ever to be rewarded; nor that it had
passed to her so lightly. Accidental, propinquitous,
seemed his love for her. Not based on congeniality, or
knowledge of sympathies. She was not vocal with him—what
did he love in her? A trick of smile or speech?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
Better that, even, than that he had yielded, simply, to
the human need of loving! Even that did not have
a sting for her this night. Life with him on any terms
she wanted. To-morrow, the proud rebellions might return;
now, she could see the risk of losing him! She
had not the trick of persuasion; only one way she knew!
When he was her own, they might face their differences,
then kiss them away! Daring, then witchery! For
she wanted to charm her husband; that, the proudest
conquest of all. The wonder it was that all women
could not see it that way. To win over again, to conquer
against commonplaceness, against satiety—to bewitch
one’s own!</p>

<p>Godfrey was returning to Australia’s clapping hands.
The desert, Gerty Hardin, were forgotten in the ardor of
his singing. To pour out song like that, to make a world
listen, be the voice that summons memory! Such a night
as this—“<i>Tanto amor—!</i>”</p>

<p>On his army cot, Wooster stirred restlessly between
his coarse cotton sheets. Something was disturbing him.
He was heavy with sleep. But something was the matter
with the night. He covered his ears, but the irritation
crept through. He raised his head from the pillow, the
small snapping eyes accusing the unknown disturber of
his peace.</p>

<p>“Those Indians!” he muttered, dragging the sheet over
his ears. “Drunk again!”</p>

<p>“<i>Tanto amor!</i>” Godfrey was looking down on the
river.</p>

<p>Such a night! It poured wine into the veins of one!
Such a voice! To pour it out, thrilling himself over the
call of it! Touching something, what was it he touched?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
That gleam of moonlight on the river, footlights of
fairies. Ah, holy night! “<i>Tanto amor!</i>”</p>

<p>Caught in his own spell, Godfrey passed down the
levee. And the camp slept again. But even the dreams
of Wooster were of love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX<br>

<small>THE BATTLE IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GATHERING on the bank were the camp groups to
watch the last stand of the river against the rock
bombardment. The reporters from the outside, pads
and pencils in hand, were there, and Brandon; Molly
Silent, with little Jim in her arms, who had crept down
from the Crossing, full of fears. Out there, somewhere
on the trestles, on one of those rock cars was her Jim.
She sat on the bank by Innes and Mrs. Marshall, who
at last had laid aside her knitting. Tony, his white cap
askew, danced from group to group, finding poor audiences.
Later, he forced a heartier reception when he
returned, bearing sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs, his
Indian “help” carrying a pot of steaming coffee.</p>

<p>“That’s a capital idea, Tony,” commended Rickard,
stopping for a snatch of lunch. “Tell Ling to do the
same; here, MacLean, you tell him. We’ll keep coffee
and bread and beans going all day. A lunch-counter
on the bank.” He was off, his hands full of sandwiches.</p>

<p>A great wave broke into an obliterating eruption of
spray. A cry burst from Molly Silent. “Oh, I thought
it was gone. There’s Jim. He’s on the car that’s pulling
in!”</p>

<p>“Give me the boy,” Mrs. Marshall reached out her
unpractised arms. “Run down and speak to your husband.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
She shook her head ominously at Innes as the
mother stumbled heavily down the bank. “This excitement
is bad for her. Before Christmas, she tells me.”
She held the little body close to hers. Innes, watching
her rapt look, felt her eyes warm up with tears.</p>

<p>Molly toddled back, radiant.</p>

<p>“I saw him!” she glowed.</p>

<p>“I got him asleep!” whispered Mrs. Marshall. “Don’t
take him; you’ll awaken him. Isn’t he looking a little
pale?”</p>

<p>There was a fear in the face which leaned over the
sleeping child. “He’s not right. I don’t know what’s
the matter with him. I’d take him out, but I can’t leave
Jim—so soon. It isn’t until Christmas. I’ll have to
go then. Do you think he looks sickly?” Her anxious
eyes questioned the two women.</p>

<p>Heartily, Innes said she thought he was looking
stronger.</p>

<p>“Let me take him out,” suggested Mrs. Marshall.
“We’ll be going this week. I’ll take the best of care
of him; there’s a splendid children’s doctor in Tucson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do!” cried Innes. And what a charity for Mrs.
Marshall, her empty arms aching for what they that
moment held!</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Molly, pain and relief in her tone.</p>

<p>“Think about it,” whispered Mrs. Marshall. “You
don’t have to tell me now.”</p>

<p>Molly lifted her head from a scrutiny of the pallid
baby face to see Mrs. Hardin, floating by in her crisp
muslins. A few feet behind stalked Godfrey, his eyes
on the pretty figure by his side. Innes, watching too,
turned from his look, abashed as though she had been
peering through a locked door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>Gaily, with a fluttering of ruffles, Gerty established
herself on the bank, a trifle out of hearing distance.
Innes saw her raise an inviting smile to the Englishman
who stood looking uncertainly from her to the river. He
dropped beside her on the sand. As Innes pulled her
eyes away from them, she met those of Molly Silent,
who had also been staring at Tom Hardin’s wife.</p>

<p>A hard little smile played on the lips accented with
Parisian rouge. The blue eyes were following the two
men who were directing the bombardment; the childish
expression was gone; her look accused life of having
trifled with her. But they would see—</p>

<p>“Don’t look so unhappy, dearest,” whispered the man
at her side. “I’m going to make you happy, dear!”
She flushed a brilliant, finished smile at him. Yes,
she was proud of him. His success buoyed her faith
in her destiny. Everybody knew Godfrey; his voice
had subdued whole continents. He satisfied her sense
of romance, or would, later, when she was away from
here, a dull pain pricking at her deliberate planning.
She was tired, tired of scheming, planning; unfair it
seemed to her that some women have all that she had
had to struggle for tossed into their careless laps. She
was proud. She could not be a nobody, crushed by
humiliations and adversity. She had not brought any
of his trouble on Tom Hardin. It was he, he and Rickard
who had ruined her life. Not quite ruined! She
was stepping out before it was too late. Godfrey found
her young, young and distracting. His life had been
hungry, too; the wife, up there in Canada somewhere,
had never understood him. Godfrey was ambitious, ambitious
as she was. She would be his wife; she would
see the cities of the world with him, the welcomed wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
of Godfrey; she would share the plaudits his wonderful
voice won.</p>

<p>His eyes were on her now, she knew, questioning,
not quite sure of her. She had worried him yesterday
because she would not pledge herself to marry him if
he sued for his divorce. Her intuition told her that
something was uncertain, his affection for her, or that
other woman’s tie, if he hinged his divorce on her promise.
“I’m not sure of you! Will you give me your
word? When I am free, you, too, will be free, waiting
for me?”</p>

<p>She had shivered away from his question. Terrible
that life put that obstacle, that dreadful process in her
way. Always life blocked her. His doubt gave her
doubts of him. Would he be faithful, a silver-voiced
Godfrey; absent, other, younger women hanging on his
voice? It did not hurt to keep a man guessing. She
had told him to ask her that after the courts had set
him free. She could not have him sure of her. Men
tire when they are sure; Rickard had been too sure of
her.</p>

<p>An exclamation from him recalled her. She found
that he was no longer staring at her; his eyes were
fixed on the trembling structure over which a “battle-ship,”
laden with rock, was creeping.</p>

<p>“Jove!” he cried. “Those men are heroes.”</p>

<p>Everything irritated her to-day. She felt out of sorts,
though she was going to be happy! She was going to
grasp, and keep what was within reach of her hand.
But this river, this dirty sordid work, was getting on
her nerves. Even Godfrey now was staring at the
trestles as though they were circus rings! Rickard
crossed her vision, on the run, his face grotesque with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
soot and perspiration. She saw him stoop to speak to
the group of women; he stood for a minute by Innes.
The grime shielded his expression, but she had seen
the girl’s face! Her own eyes darkened with anger.
But she was going to be happy. Her teeth clicked over
that slogan. No one should stand in the way, Hardin,
or that other. Rickard would see that she had never
cared for him—hateful that it must be long before she
could show him. She wanted him to know it right
away, before those two flung their secret in her face,
before Innes secretly triumphed over her.</p>

<p>Rickard, she could see, was turning in her direction.
She sent another brilliant, dazzling smile at Godfrey,
who remembered to smile back at her. She wanted to
have Rickard see them together, absorbed in each other.
It would pique his vanity, perhaps, to see how little she
cared. He would see that he had been only one of
many to her. She sent a tender little whisper after the
smile.</p>

<p>But Godfrey had been growing restless. It began to
irk him, to tease his superb muscle to be the only man
without work—“sitting on the bank like Cor’nel down
yonder!” He answered Gerty, turning away to her annoyance
to hail Rickard.</p>

<p>“Going all right?”</p>

<p>“Bully,” cried Rickard, not stopping.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you something for me to do? Can’t I help?”</p>

<p>“We can use everybody,” Rickard called back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Uncomfortable to find that that voice still had power
to make her tremble. Even when she loved Godfrey.
For she did love him. She intended to love him. Else
what did life mean? Those broken beginnings, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
false starts? It was hate, she told herself, hate that
shook her, when Rickard came near. With all her soul
she hated him.</p>

<p>Godfrey was itching to be off, but he would not offend
Mrs. Hardin. After a deliberate interval, she got up,
shaking out her ruffles. “One gets stiff sitting so long.
Don’t let me keep you.”</p>

<p>He saw he had hurt her. “I want to stay with you,
you know that, dearest. But it doesn’t feel right to see
them all working like niggers and me loafing here. You
don’t mind?”</p>

<p>Oh, no, Gerty did not mind! She was tired, anyway!
She was going back to her tent!</p>

<p>“Won’t you wait for the closure?”</p>

<p>Her laugh was airy and detached. “Oh, they are
always closing that river. They will always be closing
it. It’s no novelty. You can tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>He thrust a yellow paper into her hands. “I sent
that off to-day. Perhaps you will be glad?”</p>

<p>She flung another of her inscrutable smiles at him,
and went up the bank, the paper unread in her hands.
Godfrey’s uncertain glance followed her. He had vexed
her, some way. He should follow her, see her to her
tent. She expected those little attentions. He loved to
please her, but his eyes went back, yearning, to the river.
Those men working like tigers—! He was down the
bank in a trice.</p>

<p>“Give me something to do!”</p>

<p>The long afternoon wore away. On a giant rock on
a flat car, Silent stretched his muscles, and looked at
his watch. Mortally tired he was. He thought of his
bed, and a cup of steaming coffee. An hour more!
They were now dynamiting the largest rocks on the cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
before unloading them. The heavy loads could not be
emptied quickly enough. Not dribbled, the rock, but
dumped simultaneously, else the gravel and rock might
be washed down-stream faster than they could be put
on. The job called for an alert eye and hand working
together. Many cars must be unloaded at once; the din
on Silent’s train was terrific. His crew looked like
devils, drenched from the spray which rose from the
river each time the rock-pour began; blackened by the
smoke from the belching engine. The river was ugly
in its wrath. It was humping itself for its final stand
against the absurdity of human intention; its yellow
tail swished through the bents of the trestle.</p>

<p>“It isn’t what I’d call pretty,” yelled Wooster to
Bodefeldt, as they passed in a flat car. The noise of
the rock-pouring began again.</p>

<p>“Not a picnic,” cried Bodefeldt.</p>

<p>But there was a thrill in it. They were working
against the most formidable force in nature, against time,
and moreover without precedent. Not one of them would
risk a hazard as to the next move of the wily Dragon.
A swift rise, and swift rises of the Gila were always
to be feared, and their barrier would be flung down
the channel as a useless toy. Haste was their only
chance. The breath of the workers came quick and
short. The order came for more speed. Rickard moved
from bank to raft; knee deep in water, screaming orders
through the din; directing the gangs; speeding the rock
trains; helping Wooster, who was driving large gangs
of Mexicans and Indians. The river must not be allowed
to creep around the bulwark, to catch them unawares;
the work must not halt for an instant; the force of the
thwarted river growing fiercer with each pour of rock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
Haste against strength, or the victory the river’s! Hardin
oscillated between the levee and dams, taking orders,
giving orders. His energy was superb. His heavy run
was like a bulldog’s, full of ferocious purpose. Marshall
halted him as he thumped past, straight from the
levees.</p>

<p>“It’s going all right,” he assured the man who had
humiliated him. His sense of wrong was sleeping; the
battle developed the real soldier. “The levee will stand
if we can work quick enough.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Marshall. “We’ll win yet, old man!”</p>

<p>It had grown dark, but no one yet had thought of the
lights, the great Wells’ burners stretched across the
channel. To Marshall’s war-trained ear, the glut of
raining rock sounded like cannonading. It was a queer
scene, the dark pocket of battle-ground, the clouds of
smoke, the dashing mountains of spray; men rushing to
and fro like masked dwarfs, trains thundering on to the
trestles. Suddenly, the lights flared out.</p>

<p>Marshall found himself standing by Captain Brandon,
who had his note-book in his hand. The dark had stolen
on him; but he kept on scribbling his report to the
<i>Sun</i>. He did not hear Marshall’s inquiry.</p>

<p>Behind them, coming closer, broke a rhythmic beat.
Molly Silent’s waiting ear heard it, too—it was the night
shift coming on! She hastened clumsily to the rock filled
end of the trestle, and waited for Silent to leave
his train.</p>

<p>As he let himself down from the cab, she could hear
him say that it was about time. “I’m all in.” Just then,
the Dragon lashed its mighty foaming tail; the trestle
shook as though it were a mouse in the sharp teeth of a
terrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>The engineer who was taking Silent’s place, drew
back.</p>

<p>“That’s your train,” said Silent, who did not yet see
his wife.</p>

<p>There was another lash of the angry tail. The engineer
shook his head. “It don’t look good to me.” A
whistle blew. The trestle was still shuddering as though
in the grip of an earthquake.</p>

<p>“I’ve been an engineer for twenty years, but God
Almighty Himself’d not take me out on that bridge to-night.
I’d give up my job first.”</p>

<p>“It’s up to me, then,” said Silent. And then two arms
were thrown around his neck.</p>

<p>“Why, lassie,” he cried. “Why, little mother.”</p>

<p>She clung to him. The whistle blew again.</p>

<p>“Why, lassie!” He put her away from him, and she
saw him, though mistily, climb back into the cab, the
man-work swallowing him again.</p>

<p>Not one of those who labored or watched would ever
forget that night. The spirit of recklessness entered
even into the stolid native. The men of the Reclamation
forgot this was not their enterprise; the Hardin faction
jumped to Rickard’s orders; there was a whip of haste
in the air. Brandon’s old style came back to him as
he wrote, standing now under the great swinging light,
his report for the <i>Sun</i>. “Bertha will be reading it
to-morrow!” He despatched one bulletin, and began
another. His periods rolled off, sonorously syllabled.
Down by the trestle, humped up like a camel, the mud
washed from his hair which fell like stiff wires from his
head, watched Cor’nel. He had not eaten, had not stirred
from his place that day.</p>

<p>The rain of rocks, by midnight, had settled into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
steady storm. The momentum was gigantic. The
watchers on the bank sat tense, thrilled out of recognition
of aching muscles, or the midnight creeping chill.
No one would go home. Mrs. Marshall and Molly
Silent carried the sleeping boy into the <i>Palmyra</i>, where
he was laid in Mrs. Marshall’s bed.</p>

<p>“He’ll lie till morning, once he’s asleep,” whispered
his mother, and they crept down to the bank again. The
swinging lights had turned the darkness into a pale
twilight. Each searched through the uncertain light for
a familiar figure, for the soldier she had lent. Wistfully,
Claudia was wondering if Tod’s flannels were wet.
Once, he came within reach of her hand, but she dared
not ask him. He was on the run. “Hell! what’s the
matter with that train?”</p>

<p>To Innes, the struggle was vested in two men, Rickard
running down yonder with that light foot of his as
swift as though Ling’s mustard had not been needed a
few days before; and Hardin with the fighting mouth
tense. And somewhere, she remembered, working with
the rest, was Estrada. Those three were fighting for
the justification of a vision—an idea was at stake, a hope
for the future. There was no fear, only a wild exultation,
when she once saw Rickard jump on to an outgoing
train of “battle-ships,” heavily laden with rock.
It was a battle of giants, to her; drastic and dramatic.</p>

<p>Rickard passed and repassed her, running, or again
walking slowly, talking eagerly to Marshall. And had
not seen her! Not during those hours would he think
of her, not until the idea failed, or was triumphant,
would he turn to look for her. Knowing, the thought
unfolded slowly, knowing he would find her there!</p>

<p>The real work of the world is man-work; no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
how she or other women might yearn, theirs not the
endurance. All they can do is negative; not to get on
the track! Neither with pretty ruffles, nor tender fears!</p>

<p>Knowing he would find her <i>there</i>. Suppose she
were not there, she were off building a house when he
came home to find her, craving her comfort or her
laurels? Suppose she had promised to deliver a plan,
and that pledge involved her absence, or her attention
when the world work, the man-work released him—his
story on his eager lips, her ears deaf to hear? She saw
Brandon under the swinging light, and his loneliness
came knocking at her door. Was it still necessary for
that wife to help with the bread-getting? On some
women, that problem is thrust, but her college study,
her later reading, had taught her that all women should
seek it. An economic waste, half of the world spending
more than the other half can earn! To the woman
who has been spared the problem, comes the problem
of choice. Has any one, born a woman, the daring to
say—“I will not choose. I will take both! I will be
man and woman, too!” Suppose she were not at home
when he stumbled back to her! As soon leave that
corner of the bank!</p>

<p>Her muscles grew stiff. Once in a while, the watching
women stirred, or shifted their positions, but they
did not get up. They would stay where their man,
Marshall, or Silent, Rickard, Hardin, could find them.
Only one woman symbolized that thought, and she followed
it until it curved, bringing her back to that twilight
of clamor, the fight between disorder and plan,
waste and conservation, herself sitting on the bank
waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>Visibly, the drama moved toward its climax. Before
many hours passed, something would happen, the river
would be captured, or the idea forever mocked. Each
time a belching engine pulled across that hazardous track,
it flung a credit to the man-side. Each time the waters,
slowly rising, hurled their weight against the creaking
trestles where the rock was thin, a point was gained by
the militant river. Its roar sounded like the last cry of
a wounded animal to Innes’ ear; the Dragon was a reality
that night as it spent its rage against the shackles
of puny men.</p>

<p>Down in the shadow of a lamp-pole, the light flaring
riverward, crouched Coronel. His eyes were fixed on
those approaching walls of rock. Motionless, he watched
the final tussle, a grunt following each glut of rock.
Somewhere, his muscles ached, but his brain did not receive
their message. It was off duty. His mind was
sending that car across the trestle; it was hastening the
charge, that quick clattering downfall of shattered rock.</p>

<p>Molly Silent had seen her husband’s train pull in. She
watched for it to go out again. The whistle blew twice.
Something was wrong. She left her place in time to see
Silent, his face shining ghastly pale under the soot, pull
himself up from the “battle-ship” where he had been leaning.
Estrada, sent by Rickard to find out why the train
did not pull out, saw him the same instant as did Molly.
Silent swayed, waving them back unseeingly, like a man
who is drunk.</p>

<p>“God, man, you can’t go like that!” cried Estrada.</p>

<p>“Who’s going?” demanded Silent, his tongue thick
with thirst and exhaustion. The whistle blew again.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> will!” The train moved out on the trestle, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
whistle blew angrily twice. Only Molly and Silent saw
Estrada go. Silent staggered unseeingly up the bank,
toward the camp, Molly heavily following.</p>

<p>Workers and watchers felt a queer light playing on
their faces, but no one stopped to look at the lamps
swinging across the channel, or they would have seen
that they were growing dim. The test of strength was
coming; no time to brush the damp hair from their eyes.
The river was humping out yonder; the rolling mass
came roaring, flank-on, against the dam.</p>

<p>“Quick, for God’s sake, quick,” yelled Rickard. His
signals sounded short and sharp. “Dump it on, throw
the cars in!” Marshall was dancing, his mouth full of
oaths, on the bank edge. Breathlessly, all watched the
rushing water fling itself over the dam. For several
hushed seconds, the structure could not be seen. When
the foam fell, a cheer went up. The dam was standing.
Silent, it was supposed, was bringing in his train.</p>

<p>Above the distant jagged line of mountains, rose a
red ball. A new day began. The light fell on the facet
of the fighting men; Indians and Caucasians alike black
with river mud and soot. The work went on. And
again the Dragon rose; a mountain of water came rolling
damward.</p>

<p>“Hump yourselves,” screamed Marshall. The signals
sounded like hoarse cries.</p>

<p>Three trains ran steaming on the rails.</p>

<p>“We’ll get those rocks over before the river kicks,”
cried Rickard. “Be ready, Irish, to run in when they
come back. Don’t stop now to blast the big ones. Pour
’em on!”</p>

<p>There was a long wait before any rock fell. Marshall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
and Rickard waited for the pour. The whistles blew
again.</p>

<p>“Why in Hades,” began Marshall, and then they saw
what was wrong. The morning light showed a rock
weighing several tons which was resisting the efforts of
the pressing crew. Out of the gloom sprang other
figures with crowbars.</p>

<p>“Why don’t they try to use mountains?” swore Marshall,
and the rock tottered, fell. The river tossed it as
though it were a tennis ball, sent it hurtling down the
lower face of the dam. The river’s strength was never
more terrible.</p>

<p>“Damn those almighty fools!” screamed Tod Marshall.</p>

<p>“A fluke,” yelled Rickard.</p>

<p>Things began to go wild. The men were growing
reckless. They were sagging toward exhaustion; mistakes
were made. Another rock, as heavy as the last,
was worked toward the edge. No one listened to the
frantic signals to dynamite that rock, break it on the car.
Men were thick about it with crowbars. There was
another wait, the whistles confusing the men on the
train. They hurried. One concerted effort, drawing
back as the rock toppled over the edge. One man was
too slow, or too tired. He slipped. The watchers on
the bank saw a flash of waving arms, heard a cry; they
had a glimpse of a blackened face as the foam caught
it. The waters closed over him.</p>

<p>There was a hush of horror; a halt.</p>

<p>“God Himself couldn’t save that poor devil,” cried
Marshall. “Have the work go on!”</p>

<p>Pour rocks on that wretch down there? Pin him
down? Never had it seemed more like war! “A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
down? Ride over him! to victory!” Soberly, Rickard
signaled for the work to go on.</p>

<p>The rock-pour stuttered as if in horror. The women
turned sick with fear. No one knew who it was. Some
poor Mexican, probably.</p>

<p>Some one standing near Rickard said that it was Arnica
Jack; he said he had seen his face. He had gone
out on that train. Rickard thought of the saved salary.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t that train come in? What is the matter
with Silent?” His signals brought in the battle-ships,
moving as though they were funeral carriages.</p>

<p>“Where is Silent?” demanded Rickard, running down
to the track. A blackened figure was letting himself
down from the car. The smell of something pungent
struck sharply against Rickard’s nostrils. Arnica!
“Where’s Silent?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“’E didn’t take hout this ’ere train.” The hobo’s eyes
looked owlish.</p>

<p>“Then who?” the engineer was beginning, when it
came to him. He himself had sent Estrada to question
Silent! He knew what the tramp was going to tell him!</p>

<p>“The young Mexican, Hestrada. ’E tried to ’elp. ’E
wasn’t fit.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” Marshall had run down to see why
the work paused.</p>

<p>Rickard turned shocked eyes on his chief. “Estrada!”
The beautiful mournful eyes of Eduardo were on him,
not Marshall’s, horrified.</p>

<p>“But it came again; it kept coming. I had it while
you were all talking, just now!”</p>

<p>If that terrible smell didn’t take itself off! He hated
the stupid wretch standing, open-jawed before him, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
it was Estrada’s and not those owlish eyes that
were lying in those waters yonder.</p>

<p>“Rickard!” The engineer did not recognize the
quenched voice. “The work has got to go on.”</p>

<p>It came to Rickard as he gave the orders for the
trains to run “and be quick about it,” that Eduardo was
closer to Marshall than to him. “As near a son as he’ll
ever have.”</p>

<p>He turned a minute later to see his chief standing
bareheaded. His own cap came off.</p>

<p>“We’re burying the lad,” said Marshall. A rain of
rock struck the nerves of all of them, though less than
six people knew who it was who had paid the tribute
of life to the river. Rickard kept the smell of arnica in
his nostrils. It nauseated him. Never would its sharp
breath blow on him but that scene would shake him in
all its horror,—the sad beautiful face under those malignant
waters, the rocks nailing it down. “It kept coming.
I had it while you were all talking—just now!”</p>

<p>The minute of funeral had to be pushed aside. The
river would not wait. Train after train was rushed on
to the trestles; wave after wave hit them. But perceptibly,
the dam was steadying. The rapid fire of rock
was telling.</p>

<p>Another ridge of yellow waters rose. Every eye was
on that watery mountain; it appeared to wait, as if summoning
its strength for a final onslaught. The river’s
stillness was ominous to the sweating men who watched
as they labored that bulge of yellow water. Car after
car ran on to the track; load after load of clattering
rock was dumped. The roll of water came slowly,
dwindling as it came; it broke against the trestle weakly.
For the first time, the trestle never shuddered. Workers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
and watchers breathed as a unit the first deep breath
that night. There was a change.</p>

<p>Hardin came rushing down to the track where the
rock cars ran on to the trestles.</p>

<p>“It’s stopped rising!” he bellowed.</p>

<p>“Then work like hell!” bawled Rickard.</p>

<p>There followed some minutes of intensity when the
rock-pour was almost continuous. Was not that another
bulge of yellow waters, swelling there to the east?
Every eye was on the river where it touched the rim
of the dam. Suddenly, a chorused cry rose. The river
had stopped rising!</p>

<p>“Don’t stop! She may hump yet!” Rickard was splitting
his voice against the cheers. The whistles screamed
themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>“We’ve got her!” screamed Hardin. “She’s going
down!”</p>

<p>And then a girl, sitting on the bank, saw two men
grab each other by the hand. She was too far away to
hear their voices, but the sun, rising red through the
banks of smoke, fell on the blackened faces of her
brother and Rickard. She did not care who saw her
crying.</p>

<p>A small sound started down the river. It grew into
a swelling cheer, the pæan of victory. It demoralized
into wild yells. Suddenly, the noise stopped. Simultaneously,
Marshall and Rickard had held up their
hands. The whistles had blown.</p>

<p>“What was that for?” demanded Mrs. Marshall.</p>

<p>“I suppose they can’t afford to waste any time.”
Innes’ reply was uncertain. She, too, was wondering.</p>

<p>Rickard, they could hear, again, screaming directions.
The battle was won; but it must be kept won. But no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
cheering! The men didn’t know who it was who was
buried out yonder.</p>

<p>When things were well under way, Rickard discovered
that his head was hot, his skin chilly. He would lay off
for an hour. He would put Hardin in his place, Hardin
or Irish.</p>

<p>He found Hardin, who was having his minute of reaction.
This was not his triumph. Sullenly, he accepted
Rickard’s place. Rickard turned back. “Had you
heard? That was Estrada out there.”</p>

<p>Hardin’s expression followed him, the gloom of sullen
egotism passing slowly from the face of unwilling horror.
He had not spoken, but his look said: “Not Estrada!
Any one but Estrada!”</p>

<p>“Any one but Estrada! He’s about the only man in
this camp without enmities,” thought Rickard, and then
he wondered if any one had told Innes Hardin. He
went in search of her, passing Coronel, whose head
rested on his chest. His snores could be heard above the
noise of the rock bombardment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall, weeping, was being led back to the car
by her husband. Innes, he could see, had heard! Her
eyes, fixed on the conquered waters, were seeing Estrada,
buried out there.</p>

<p>Rickard turned away without being seen. The minute
he had been waiting for was not his. It belonged to
Estrada.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XL<br>

<small>A DESERTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the afternoon waned, and Godfrey did not
follow her, Gerty was roused to uneasiness. Had
she angered him by refusing to make the definite promise?
Could it be love, the sort of love she wanted, if he
could stay away like this when they could have the camp
to themselves, every one down at the break, no Hardins
running in every minute? Their first chance, and Godfrey
slighting it! Something was wrong. The Godfrey
who had rushed on work like a glad hungry tiger, was
incomprehensible to her. Something must have happened.</p>

<p>She ruffled down to a disordered mess-tent. Wooster
and one of the Reclamation Service men were leaving as
she went in. She had the table to herself. MacLean, Jr.,
untidy, his clothes wet and dirty, came in to snatch a
bite, as she passed out, gay, indifferent. No Godfrey in
sight! Nor waiting for her in her tent. He would
surely come that evening, knowing that she would be
alone! She arranged without conscious thought the
setting for a scene of pretty domesticity in the ramada.
After an hour or more, she tossed down the fluffy sewing
and picked up a novel, her work within reach of her
hand. The approach of her own climax dulled the
printed sensations.</p>

<p>The little watch Tom had given her for an almost forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
birthday set the pace for her resentment. Nine,
ten, eleven! How dared he treat her so? She blew out
the lamps when she found that she was shaking with
anger, and undressed in the dark. She could not see
him, if he came now, her self-control all gone! But she
could not go to bed. She stood in her darkened tent,
shaken by her angry passions. Cruel, these men to her.
That black moment stripped her thoughts to nakedness.
If she had any other refuge, she would never forgive
him, never. But what else could she do? Where could
she go? Those lonely, straitened widowhoods! Not
for her. She had been poor long enough. Even her
little importance, as the wife of Thomas Hardin, was
gone. She dared not lose her hold on Godfrey. It came
to her then, how slight her hold on him was. A rover
with a conquering voice like that! Keep him tied to her
wrist like a tamed falcon?</p>

<p>Suppose that he were only trifling with her? What
was that paper he had thrust in her hand? Where had
she laid it? Had she dropped it on the way from the
river? She groped for a match, and lighted a candle. Not
in the dress she had on, for none of her gowns had
pockets. Not on the floor, nor on the piano! There!
She had dropped candle grease all over the green mandarin
skirt, but she didn’t care. A fond message, perhaps,
and she had lost it—out there somewhere, food for
horrid talk! Her bureau drawers were ransacked in a
frenzy of fear and haste. Suddenly, she remembered
putting it in her handkerchief box.</p>

<p>Candle grease dripped over the yellow paper. It was
a copy of a telegram to Godfrey’s lawyer. “Start divorce
proceedings at once. Any grounds possible. Back
soon. Godfrey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>The frightened blood resumed its normal flow. If he
had done this, for her, then she had not lost him. But
she had seen what a desert her life would be, if she let
him slip through her fingers. She couldn’t endure Tom
Hardin. And Rickard—they would expect her to play
the glad grandmother to their young romance! She
couldn’t get away quick enough.</p>

<p>It was then the courage came to her. She would not
be there to be told of it. An apparent elopement, why
had she never thought of that before? That would cement
their bond. Her scruples could grow on the road.
Oh, she could manage Godfrey! They would startle
the world, a continent! Godfrey was well known. It
would seem splendid; they would believe her happy.
She would be happy! When she could get away from
them all, she would forget the look that sobered Rickard’s
eyes when they fell on Innes. That still had power
to sting her. Away, she would find that it was only
anger. She did not care for him—she hated them all.
If Godfrey gave her happiness, she would keep him
transported. She knew she could. If only she did not
feel so tired! So strangely old!</p>

<p>She blew out the candle, and went to the door of the
tent-house. A low line of smoke clouds shut out the
river. Lines of hatred took possession of her face. No
one could have called it childish or pretty then. There
they all were, the people who had wrecked her life, the
Hardins, Rickard, Godfrey even, whom they would take
from her if they got the chance. She would not give
them that chance! She would go with him. She
whipped herself into a pale imitation of excitement,
telling herself that Godfrey’s importance would make
their affair internationally conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>She was going to be happy. Perhaps that would cloud
the mockery of Rickard’s quizzical eyes. She was quite
sure that she hated him. And Tom? She would not let
herself think of him! Had he not sacrificed her youth,
taken her into a country which ravages a woman’s
beauty, keeping her there until her chance to escape, her
youth, is almost gone? Her years smote her. She remembered
that she must go to bed if she were to have
any looks in the morning.</p>

<p>When Godfrey came to her the next afternoon, penitent,
refreshed after a long morning’s sleep, he found
a charming hostess. Self-controlled, she listened to the
story of the capture, and deflected his apology. Serpent-wise,
she smiled at him and called him a great foolish
boy! She was shy about his telegram. She fled through
a forest of phrases and he found he was running after
her.</p>

<p>“You must go!” Enchantingly distant when he tried
to reach her hand! “We can’t keep this up.” How
tired she felt!</p>

<p>“I can’t go without you,” he cried. He had discovered
her interpretation of his telegram, and it delighted him;
he began to believe it his own intention. “I can’t leave
you. You will elude me. I shall carry you off with me.
I can’t leave you to your scruples, Gerty, dear. I respect
you for them, darling, you know that. But I’ve
got to keep near you to strengthen your will.”</p>

<p>She shut her eyes because she could not force fervor
into them; his were demanding it. How easy it had
been! He was as plastic clay in her hands. He thought
that she was suffering. Life had been hard on her. Poor
little girl!</p>

<p>“I know. You shrink from it all. Don’t you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
I know, dear? You dread the steps that will free you—for
he has been your husband—you remember that; you
will forget how he has treated you. You need me beside
you to help you. Let’s cut the knot. That makes it all
easy. To-night!”</p>

<p>“Not to-night. Maybe, to-morrow,” whispered Gerty,
and then she managed a few tears, and he was allowed
to kiss her. It was all arranged before he left the
ramada. They were to leave together the next day.</p>

<p>She had let him sketch their trip to New York. She
did not tell him that she was going to stay in Los Angeles
until the divorces were obtained, unless she had
to go to Reno. Plenty of time for scruples to send forth
long branches of regret between Yuma and Los Angeles;
her object would be accomplished by their leaving together.
He would feel that he owed her his name.</p>

<p>Of course, Gerty must do it the conventional way!
She would have used rope ladders had they been needed.
The conventional note was pinned to her bureau scarf.</p>

<p>Innes was with Tom when he found it. They came in
together from the river. Neither had noticed the odd
looks from the men as they passed through the encampment.
A dozen men had seen Hardin’s wife leave for
the North with Godfrey.</p>

<p>Gerty’s letter told Tom that it was all over. She had
tried to stand it, to be true even through his cruelty, but
a feeling stronger than she was made her true to herself,
and so true at last to him! Falsely dramatic, every
word of it, romantically cruel.</p>

<p>Innes’ revulsion lacked speech. The fulfilment of her
intuitions left a smudge; indelible, she knew when she
looked at Tom’s face. She stretched out her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
mutely for the letter. The common blatter sickened her.
She could offer no comfort. His eyes told her it was
worse than death.</p>

<p>He struck off her hand when it touched his shoulder.
Gerty’s hand had coerced him that way. He was done
with softness.</p>

<p>His silence oppressed her. This was a man she did
not know; inarticulate, smitten. She told herself that
even a sister was an intruder—but she was afraid to
leave him alone. She went out, pitifully, questioning
those tense face-muscles. She took a station by her own
tent door. She would not go down to dinner. Tom, in
that mood, frightened her. For hours, she watched his
tent. When it grew dark, she could no longer endure
it. He did not answer her knock. She found him where
she had left him. But it was a different Hardin. The
backward look now for him. He had buried, in those
hours, his optimism. His life was lived. Gerty’s blow
had made of him an old man.</p>

<p>She forced herself toward the volcano’s edge; and
the swift eruption scorched her. It was the pitiable
wreck of dignity, of pride. His words were incoherent;
his wrath involved his sister, crouching in tears. When
he was done, he began hurling clothes and brushes indiscriminately
into his Gladstone.</p>

<p>“You are not going after them?” She had not gathered
his plan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going after them,” he shouted. “I’m not
wanted, you mean. An uninvited guest. I’ll give them
a chance for reciprocity.”</p>

<p>She caught his arm. “Tom,” she pleaded, “you can’t
go like this. Wait until you are calm. Until you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
see this clearly.” She thought then that he meant to
kill Godfrey.</p>

<p>His plan, when at last she pieced together his distorted
idea, was so sullen, so determined, that her slight
weapons could not cope with it. He had promised to
protect Gerty, he kept repeating. Well, he would keep
his vows, if she didn’t. He drew, she could see, a grim
satisfaction from that antithesis. He would keep <i>his</i>
vows. He would make that scoundrel promise on oath
to divorce the other woman and marry the woman whom
he had dishonored. Unless he got that promise, Hardin
swore to kill him. Pacing up and down the canvased
cage of a tent, he delivered himself of his fury.</p>

<p>Innes shrank from him, the man she did not know.
The coarse streak was uncovered in all its repulsiveness.
Old Jasper Gingg’s face leered through the features of
his descendant. Dementia and atavism glared through
his eyes. His hate was disfiguring. “I’ll protect my
wife. I’ll keep my vows.”</p>

<p>He turned on Innes suddenly. She was crying, a
huddled heap on the couch. “I’ve had enough crying—between
you and Gerty. Will you get out? I’ve got to
have some sleep.”</p>

<p>Through her sobs, he could make out that she was
afraid to leave him. He stood staring at her, frowning
at her fright, her intrusion.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll go. I’m used to having to leave my
own tent. A dog’s life.” He flung out into the night.</p>

<p>She cried to him to come back, that she would go.
“Don’t, Tom! Tom!” Her voice rang through the encampment.
The echo warned her. She saw questioning
slits of light from tents across the trapezium. She shut
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>She stood in the room he had left; the desecrated
home of Tom Hardin. It was the wreck she had foreseen.
She would sit up for him. She could not sit
there watching that hateful, leering mandarin skirt,
daubed with candle-drippings; those sketches; everything
recalled Gerty Hardin’s wistful baby smile. She
could not bring herself to lie on that couch. She thrust
her arms into Tom’s overcoat, buttoning it around her,
and went out to wait for him. His own cot was there.</p>

<p>A light shone from Rickard’s window. The peace of
the stars, the light from the window, smoothed out her
terrors. She could picture Tom walking out his trouble,
crying out his hurt to those same distant stars.</p>

<p>How fierce the resentment against pain! The atom
beating his head in revolt against the universe! That
particular sting, Tom’s; another kind of sorrow the next
man’s heritage! But the stars know it, those worlds of
burned-out griefs; to them how tenderly humorous, she
thought, must be each individual resistance. A short
span, a little joy, perhaps; a little sorrow; rebellion;—and
then the stars again.</p>

<p>To-night, it was all sorrow. Down there, under the
rocks, lay Estrada. Tripped to his end by the prophecy
of the general, the son the corner-stone of his undertaking!
In the river of his plan the best of them lay
sleeping!</p>

<p>Who can measure the influence upon youth the legends
of its country, the effect of its brave early history?
Would any of those coming later fail to find the thrill
in the story of the man who had visioned the idea, the
son whose eager service to a comrade had consecrated
it?</p>

<p>A short span:—and a little joy, perhaps! Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
sought the light from Rickard’s window. A little joy,—and
then the stars—again!</p>

<p>Slowly, the universe cradled her. She was in her
first deep sleep when a step passed her. A hand fumbled
uncertainly over the surface of the door; knocked
gently. A heavy bundle dropped to the threshold.
Again the figure passed the occupied cot, and paused,
going on again, more softly.</p>

<p>No quickened pulse told MacLean, Jr., that it was
Innes Hardin sleeping in her brother’s cot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLI<br>

<small>INCOMPLETENESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STUMBLING and blind, Hardin pushed without volition
toward the river which was sending its peaceful
waters once again to the gulf. When he awoke to himself
and the night, he was on the levee.</p>

<p>His bitterness was coloring both strands of his life.
Strange, that a man’s attainment can bring him neither
pride nor joy, his own achievement winning him dishonor
in a double sense! The triumph of that mound
of earth, of those turned waters, was not his. Gerty
had felt it; else she had not flouted him. In everything
he had failed. Life held only jeers for him.</p>

<p>Nothing in Hardin’s experience, or in his specialized
reading had helped him to a philosophy of life; the books
men live by were not his; and his crude egotism, as raw
to-day as when he was twenty-five, in the moment of his
trial tripped him to his fall. In all his jaundiced world,
there was no rosy finger of light. His wounded shadow
obscured the universe. His suffering, he felt, was unparalleled,
because it was undeserved. What had betrayed
him? His bitterness was crying to the stars.
Where was the fault?</p>

<p>He kept telling himself that it was not true. He would
wake up and find himself in his tent, under those same
mocking stars; he would discover it to be a hideous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
dream. Why for him this bite of hate, cried his bleeding
ego? It was as though life, which he had been pursuing,
had turned suddenly on him, savage and virulent,
had bitten him to the bone. It wasn’t true, cried his
resistance, because it wouldn’t be right! This crash
violated all his plans, warped his world, accused his
judgments. This the Hardin who had followed a deliberate
trail ever since that morning of resolution in
this yet unawakened desert? In what had that man
failed, where had he missed? Misfortune, trouble, he
had thought of vaguely as a punishment for sin, or negligence,
as do most eager spirits, before it comes! Himself!
Tom Hardin,—why, life had scarcely begun!
Why, since that moment, his path had known no turning;
one woman, one ambition; selflessness. Something was
wrong; the umpire caught napping!</p>

<p>His training betrayed him into a thicket of amaze, of
protest. His mental processes kept him in a circle of
tangled underbrush. What was physical pain, he cried,
to the torture of his mind? What the agony of death?</p>

<p>Stumbling along the levee of his buried hopes, by the
peaceful chained river of his dedication, it came to him,
the Ultimate, the end of it all. Until then death had
been kept in its decent background. The one incontrovertible
fact of the universe stared him now in the
face. Heretofore, his struggle had been set to the tune
of life; now, the rest of the way, he was facing death.
For what is death but the failure to live? That was
where he, Hardin, had failed. He touched at a thought
of brotherhood, the realization dim. Death had come to
Eduardo swiftly; but others it follows, cloaking its face,
slowly stalking its victim down! Now he knew what
would be <i>his</i> companion the rest of the way!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>Brandon, walking out a philosophic, bloodless vigil,
came upon the distorted, reeling fugitive. The starlight
showed the face tortured. No safety for that staggering
derelict without a pilot! He grabbed Hardin by the
arm, and with gentle force, directed his steps. He
talked of himself, his voice tuned to the stillness of the
night.</p>

<p>“I like to walk before I turn in. I go to sleep quicker.
I have no dreams then. ‘No dreams, dear God, no
dreams.’ That is the mile-post of age, I think. We
cling to our dreams in our youth. When we begin to
grow old, we pray for sleep, which is the beginning of
the prayer for death. It is our preparation for the long
sleep.” He would not see the scowl that disfigured
Hardin’s features.</p>

<p>“I often think of that blessing of ours. Wondering
if men could endure what they like to call their supreme
blessing, life, if we were not able to sleep away half of
it. We die half of our life, eagerly, that we may live
the other half. Strange, that!”</p>

<p>Hardin thought that he was too full of pain, of intolerance
to listen, but the calm voice reached his fleeing
thoughts. The final sleep, release? Sharply, he looked
at Brandon’s straight clean profile, ascetic in its intellectual
purity, sweet as a woman’s. What had <i>his</i> life
been? Brandon kept on with his quiet reflection, but
Hardin was wandering afield. His thoughts were growing
centrifugal, sympathetic. Brandon, too, had failed!</p>

<p>He found that his companion had been talking about
the river’s capture. He caught a phrase now and again,
but his thoughts hovered over his own hurt as vultures
over a dying body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>“That was a great battle,” Brandon was saying. “And
this the sort of field on which our future battles will be
fought. It’s modern warfare. In a few years the names
of those generals will be forgotten. We call ourselves
civilized, yet we put up statues to a man who bombards
and burns a town of savages. We’ll learn to do things
differently. We’ll learn our real values. When the
world begins to crowd up, we’ll find the value of these
waste places. And we’ll give titles to men like the older
Estrada.” Hardin was thrown against another wrong.
He forgot that Brandon was droning. Suddenly, a personal
note was sounded. He woke to hear Brandon’s
conclusion:</p>

<p>“You think you will, but you won’t. You won’t do
anything to him. You won’t want to.”</p>

<p>Hardin stood still. He stared at Brandon. What was
he talking about? It sounded like necromancy. He had
said nothing of Godfrey.</p>

<p>“You won’t harm him.” Brandon linked his arm
through the withdrawn one of Hardin and pressed him
into step.</p>

<p>“You saw them?” Of course, everybody knew by
this time that Gerty had left him! They had taken no
pains to spare him, throwing publicly their scorn of him
in his face!</p>

<p>“I was at the station. I think I know how you feel.
How any man would feel. Plan it, kill him with your
hands. Hate him; get it out of you. Kill him before
you go to sleep.” Hardin was staring like a sleep-walker.
“Get it out of your system; it’s poison. When you leave
me”—but Brandon did not intend that to be soon—“go
home and write to them both. Then you can sleep. To-morrow,
it will be done. Then burn the letter. Satisfy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
the animal, or it will be at your bedside waiting in the
morning. I always write out my anger, before I sleep.
Do you remember the Lincoln story? I’ve adopted that.”</p>

<p>Hardin shut his ears to the anecdote with rude intention.
Stories! What had he to do with after-dinner
stories a night like this? Brandon was walking a little
faster. He intended to tire out Hardin. He finished his
whimsical reminiscence. “Yes, I always burn those letters.
But I write them first. It’s a good way, the Lincoln
way.”</p>

<p>Hardin turned on him, his twisted features unpleasant
to see. “You think I mean to hurt him, kill him. We
are not living in dueling times. I wouldn’t touch the—skunk.”</p>

<p>An ulcer had been pricked. His voice was calmer.
The plan came out, the ugly revenge of distorted chivalry
and hate and duty. Brandon’s low murmurs of attention
passed for assent. Hardin did not notice that
they were within sight of the encampment, nor that
Brandon wheeled to retrace their steps. He took Brandon
back into the beginnings of things, his cramped
youth, his ambition, his awakening in that very desert,
his final dedication to one woman, one idea. It was a
passionate self-eulogy, the relief of the wounded self-esteem.
Everything had mocked him. What use were
such sacrifices, if this be the end? He demanded an
answer of the eternal. As well be a beast—the punishment
no worse!</p>

<p>His fury had shouted itself hoarse, stridulous. She
was still his wife—he still had a duty to perform, he
maintained, the duty of protection. It was grotesque, a
Frankenstein of rage, but there was no smile in Brandon’s
heart. He waited for the storm to exhaust itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
Even when Hardin had finished, he hesitated; his words
must be water, not fuel to those scorching fires.</p>

<p>“It’s good as far as you see it,” he was beginning.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s right,” thundered Hardin. “She’s not
to be thrown aside, my wife—”</p>

<p>“No, but Godfrey’s wife is.” Brandon added no comment.</p>

<p>“Well, what of that? That’s his lookout, isn’t it? He
should have thought about that before. I’ll stand by
Gerty, God Almighty, until the end.”</p>

<p>He walked on sulking.</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> wife. Because she is <i>your</i> wife. It’s the pronoun,
not the sex, or the relation. She’s yours, that is,
she was. Oh, we recognize the marriage ceremony, we
men to-day, but we go farther, we acknowledge the unwritten
sacrament, inclination. If she no longer wants
to be your wife, she’s not your wife, Hardin. You don’t
want her. Let her alone. You have no more right to
her, or to her life, after yesterday, than though she were
a dollar on another man’s desk. You’re not a savage.
And she’s not a child. She knows the world. She can
protect herself, oh, better than you can.”</p>

<p>Hardin flung out a protest to this startling twist of
facts. Brandon let him get tangled in his angry rush.</p>

<p>“The river,” began Brandon, as though they had been
discussing it. “You have done this thing, but yours is
not the credit, the published honor. It’s Marshall’s and
Rickard’s. Yet the thing is done as you wanted it, approximately.
I heard that it was you who went after
Faraday. Now the success stings you. <i>Yours</i> is neither
the power nor the glory. The pronoun again, Mr. Hardin!”</p>

<p>Beside them ran the river, guileless, now, in its captivity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
The flat world stretched away from them until
it ran into a blur of rising shadow, of dim mountain
ranges. The world was sleeping; only the stars watched.
In spite of his resistance, the quiet came creeping into
Hardin’s soul. His muscles were relaxing; he was slipping
toward sleep.</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered, too,” Brandon took a slower tempo,
“if we could not see men better by searching for their
apex. Perhaps you’ve never looked at life that way?”</p>

<p>The ugly lip flared. Hardin couldn’t see what Brandon
was driving at. He’d never had time to sit still and
look at life! He’d just lived! Just worked along!</p>

<p>“What are we doing? Climbing up a mountain.
Whatever we call this journey of ours, ambition, labor;
life. We climb up; we creep down. We are taught to
climb up, plenty of teachers for that, all the way along.
No one shows us when to begin to crawl down. When
we reach the apex, that’s the trial. Why? We don’t
know it’s the apex. We’ve achieved all we can. Achieved
or failed. We fail, anyway, there, because we find
we can’t climb any more. We’re in the habit of climbing;
we’ve a lust for it. No slippers and easy chair
yet for us. We tell ourselves it’s slothful not to climb.
We keep on, and we fall. We must learn to creep; we
are leaving our apex. That’s when we need help, a
voice out of a book, or a friend’s to help us and say,
‘You’ve not failed! You went as far as you could.
You’ve done your part. The young men will do the
rest, the ones who come after. They’ll take the place
you leave. Why, man, you yourself, took another’s.
Creep down cheerfully. You’ve lived. It’s the eternal
plan!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>Hardin did not speak, but his eyes had left the ground.</p>

<p>“Look at this desert. I reckon that there’s no man
who knows better than I do just what you’ve done.
You’ve gone ahead when others laughed at you. You’ve
worked when others slept.”</p>

<p>Hardin’s head lost its shamed droop. Some one knew
what he had done. Gerty had known, too, but she was
ashamed of him. To her, he had failed.</p>

<p>“Don’t covet all the parts, Hardin. You started it,
you and Estrada. He’s had less fun out of it, even,
than you. I know that you sacrificed your position to
get the thing pulled through. It was a grand thing to
do, better than putting the harness on the river. I’m
proud to know you.”</p>

<p>The stormy blood began its normal flow. He could
look at the river, now, not ashamed. A few minutes
later, he remembered to ask, “What do you mean by
my part?”</p>

<p>“Your ego, Hardin. Our ego. It tells us in our youth
to do everything, that all the parts are calling for us.
But one man can’t fill more than one part. Then it’s
time to get off the stage. Make room for the young
men; they’re waiting for their chance. Why, Hardin,
<i>you</i> don’t have to write your name all over this desert!
It’s here! The world may mention Marshall, or Rickard
when they speak of the Colorado, but there’s not a
man in this valley, nor one who comes after, who’ll fail
to take off his hat to Tom Hardin!”</p>

<p>Hardin stopped with a jerk. “Do you think that’s
true?”</p>

<p>A steady smile, paternal in its sweetness, answered
him. “I know it’s true. But what difference does that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
make? <i>You</i> know. You are on good terms with yourself.
That’s all we ought to want. It’s a fact. Creep
down cheerfully.”</p>

<p>The two men struck homeward. The chill that precedes
the desert dawn was in the air.</p>

<p>“I yearned for completeness, too,” mused Brandon.
“We’re made that way. I thought that that was what
life was. A complete thing. We begin to believe in that
when we are tugging at our mother’s skirts. When we
grow older, we fight for it. Not until we reach our
apex, not until we begin to think about death, do we discover
that there is no such thing as individual completion.
Did you ever hear of a rounded life, or a complete
one? We live too long, Hardin, or die too soon. It’s
creeping paralysis, or an accident in the street. We
never finish anything, even ourselves! We were never
intended to, that’s my philosophy. Our ego blinds us
to that. We can only help the scheme along.”</p>

<p>“Go on talking,” said Hardin. Brandon had thrown
him back to his own centrifugal and nebulous thought.</p>

<p>He was trudging now, his step grown weary, in the
direction of the encampment. He could see in the distance
his deserted tent. But his mood had softened.
The stream of his shackling connoted his success, as this
man had said. The valley beyond, yielding its harvest
of happy homes, that had he done. Perhaps, after all,
he had not altogether failed. And, at last, he looked up
at the stars.</p>

<p>Before they reached the camp Brandon spoke again.
“I can remember when I discovered that that was not
the plan. I’d just had my knockout. I could not see
any reason in it. For my wife to have to stay behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
me, to support me until I was strong enough to get
started, or could find a berth out here—it wasn’t the
thing I wanted! I wasn’t pleasant to have around. I
moaned a good deal to Bertha about failure. I was a
failure, as a hero! I had to go to Boston to sell a piece
of property. If I sold it, I thought I could take Bertha
west with me. I did not sell it. I went in to a symphony
concert after the deal fell through. I was full of rebellion;
the apex had come too soon. I guess it always
seems that way, whether we’re fifty, or twenty-nine.
The music itself, the sounds did not soothe me. I was
thinking of my paper, my ambition. Ambition in a desert?
It had a mocking sound. I wanted to support my
wife!</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listening to the music. I found I was watching
the antics of the man with the violoncello. He’d sit
for a while and never make a sound. It struck me as
queer that a man could be willing to spend a lifetime
learning to play a thing like that, spend an afternoon to
come in, just once in a while! Just a few notes a day!
I suppose you’ll laugh at me, for we get our lessons different
ways. I got mine from that ’cello player. It
came to me then, the apex philosophy. I got a view at
the scheme of things. Men’s incompleteness, the brotherhood
of man, our broken segments making up the
whole; I remember when I left, I was trying to whistle
a theme from that great <i>Pathetique</i>! I never shall forget
that afternoon. I think of that ’cello player, think
of my life that way. We are all playing in the symphony,
some of us carry the tune a little further, some of us,
like the ’cello player, content to fill out the harmonies.”</p>

<p>They had reached the encampment. “I believe I’ll
turn in,” gruffed Hardin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>“Good night.” Brandon struck off to his tent.</p>

<p>Hardin found Innes asleep, huddled in his overcoat.
He did not waken her. On his threshold he stumbled
over a clumsy bundle. Paper, torn, paper wrappings,
crackled under his fingers. He carried it into his tent
and shut the door before striking a match, so as not to
waken her. In the dark, he fumbled through the room
for a match. Before lighting a candle, the flickering
match in his hand, he pulled down the tent shades lest
the light arouse Innes. He didn’t want any more woman
talk! He was stumbling off to bed when his eyes fell on
the fat parcel. The shape intrigued his curiosity.</p>

<p>It was soiled and racked from traveling. The labels
read “Jalisco; Nogales; Guadalajara; Tepic.” He
searched for the original address. At last he made out
a blurred and muddied “Hardin.” Scrawled in by recent
fingers was “The Crossing, Mexico.”</p>

<p>On the table he unwound its dirty wrappings. A covering
of cheese-cloth lined the paper shells. Hardin’s
weary eyes questioned the odd-looking cushion. His
fingers ran over the rigid curves. It came to him then,
what it was. Gerty’s form! And he sat it up on its
waist-line.</p>

<p>Through Mexico, jostled from town to town; written
about, speculated on, sorely needed every time one of
those dainty gowns was made, “those pretty flimsy
gowns of Gert’s!” At last it had come to the Heading!</p>

<p>He stared at it vacantly.</p>

<p>Something was happening within him; a childishness
he could not control. The shuddering storm swept over
him as a dry autumn wind that strips the trees gaunt.</p>

<p>He staggered to the candle and blew out its wavering
flame. Picking up the shape, he stole with it into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
next room. He knelt by the bed that had been Gerty’s.
And the grandson of old Jasper Gingg cried out his
hurt, with his arms around that unyielding waist, his
head against that stuffed bosom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLII<br>

<small>A CORNER OF HIS HEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE second evening after the closure Rickard was
dining with the Marshalls in their car. The <i>Palmyra</i>
was preparing to leave the siding. She was to
pull out the next day. Already Marshall was restless.
Tucson was calling him; Oaxaca was calling him! And
he was due in Chicago for a conference with Faraday.</p>

<p>Rickard had been protesting against his new orders.
It hurt him to curtail his force. “Not until the concrete
gate is finished, and the whole length of levee done, will
I feel safe.”</p>

<p>“Faraday says to go slow,” repeated Marshall. “He’s
got something up his sleeve. It may be taken off his
hands. If that’s the case, we’ve done our part.”</p>

<p>“I like to leave my work finished, not hanging in mid-air,”
grumbled the engineer. “He’d hate to do this over
again. I would! You will advise him when you see him
next week, Mr. Marshall? Don’t let him cut down on
the force we have now. Let us keep,” and then he
smiled, “as many as we can!”</p>

<p>For the hobo ranks were thinning as late snows beneath
the sun. Up North, a city was rebuilding. In
Mexico, new mines were being opened up. The west
coast of Mexico was calling to those restless soldiers
who march without a captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>“They are going out by way of Calexico,” Rickard
was still smiling over some memories of desertion.
“They’ve learned that they can hoof it to Cocopah, and
from there sneak in on the work-trains. Work crews
are more vulnerable than regular brakemen; they have
more imagination. To them, these returning hoboes are
heroes. It was they who saved the valley, not you, Mr.
Marshall! That’s their opinion.”</p>

<p>“I preferred my ‘snap’ myself!” returned Marshall.
“Have you cut down on the Indians?”</p>

<p>Rickard nodded, remembering how Hardin had opposed
himself yesterday to the number of men retained;
as being twice too many! The same Hardin! An awkward
relationship swung toward the two men. Hardin,
it was easy to see, was striving to remember his gratitude
to the man who had stopped the river. He himself
had different reasons for wishing to be fair to Tom
Hardin! His name was brought up by Tod Marshall.
“She was light potatoes,” he dismissed the woman. “But
she’s broken the man’s spirit.”</p>

<p>Rickard, it was discovered, had nothing to say on the
subject of the elopement.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry his sister is not here to-night,” began Marshall
mischievously.</p>

<p>“I did ask her, Tod,” Claudia hastened to interrupt
her lord. “But she would not leave her brother her last
evening.”</p>

<p>“Her <i>last</i> evening?” exclaimed Rickard. “Is she going
away?”</p>

<p>Marshall subdued his twinkle. “We are carrying her
off. She is to visit Mrs. Marshall while I am on the
road.”</p>

<p>“Just a few days,” put in his wife. “She feels that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
her brother wants to be by himself. I think she is right.”</p>

<p>And the <i>Palmyra</i> made early runs! He must see her
that night. He would leave as soon as he decently could.
Tony’s dinner was endless to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall found opportunity in her guest’s abstraction
to explain to her husband that at last Mrs.
Silent had consented to let her take the boy, Jimmie,
“out” with her.</p>

<p>“She’s not well herself. Another!” She arched her
eyebrows meaningly.</p>

<p>Rickard gulped down his coffee, boiling. Tony was
looking with tragic concern at the untasted dessert on
the engineer’s plate. “Mrs. Marshall, will you let me
run away early?” Why should he give any excuse?
They knew what he was running away for!</p>

<p>He made his way to the little white tent on the far
side of the trapezium. The door was open, the lamplight
flaring through. He could see Coronel struggling
with the straps of a brass-bound trunk. Innes, by the
door, was bidding good-by to Señora Maldonado.</p>

<p>He could hear her voice as he drew near. “You’ll let
me hear from you? How you are getting on? And the
children?”</p>

<p>He forgot to greet the Mexican. She stood waiting;
her eyes full of him. Surely, the kind señor had something
to say to her? He had taken the white girl’s hand.
He was staring into the white girl’s eyes. Something
came to her, a memory like forgotten music. Silently,
she slipped away into the night.</p>

<p>Rickard would not release Innes’ hand; her eyes could
not meet the look in his.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she good to come? She rode, horseback, all
the way up here just to say good-by to me. She is going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
to Nogales to live, taking the children. She thinks
she has a good chance there. She asked me to tell you.”
Her chatter, too, dropped before his silence. He kept
her hand in his.</p>

<p>“Come out and have a walk with me! It’s not too
late?”</p>

<p>Her foolish, chattering speech all mute!</p>

<p>“The levee?” asked Rickard. Still holding her hand,
he drew it through the loop of his arm.</p>

<p>“You were not going to tell me you were going?”</p>

<p>No answer to that either! How could she tell him she
was going when she knew what she knew!</p>

<p>“You were running away from me?” He leaned down
to her face.</p>

<p>If she dared, she would be pert with him; she would
not have to <i>run</i> away from him!</p>

<p>“You know that I love you! I have been waiting for
this minute, this woman, all these lonely years.”</p>

<p>Her head she kept turned from him. He could not see
the little maternal smile that ran around the curves of
her mouth. Those years, filled to the brim with stern
work, had not been lonely. Lonely moments he had had,
that was all. She could understand how a man like
Rickard would find those moments lonely. There, he
and Tom stood together. He was asking her to fill those
minutes; those only. But he did not know that. He
would not know what she meant if she told him that he
was asking her to fill a corner of his heart!</p>

<p>“Nothing for me?” He stopped, and made her face
him, by taking both of her hands in his.</p>

<p>She would not look at him yet, would not meet the
look which always compelled her will, stultified her
speech. She had something to say first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>“We don’t know each other; that is, you don’t know
me!” She was not going to let them make that mistake,
let him make that mistake!</p>

<p>“Is that all?” There was relief in his voice. For a
bad moment he had wondered if it was possible, if
Estrada—“I don’t know you? Haven’t I seen you day
by day? Haven’t I seen your self-control tried, proved—haven’t
I seen your justice, when you could not understand— Look
at me!”</p>

<p>She shook her head, her eyes on the sand under her
feet. He could scarcely catch her words. They did not
know each other. He did not know her!</p>

<p>“Dear! I don’t know whether you love red or blue,
that’s a fact; Ibsen or Rostand; heat or cold. Does that
matter? I know you!”</p>

<p>An upward glance had caught him smiling. Her
speech was routed. “I’m—the—only girl here!”</p>

<p>“Do you think that’s why I love you?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you loved Gerty!” That slipped from her.
She had not meant to say that!</p>

<p>“Does that hurt?” Abashed by her own daring, yet
she was glad she had dared. She wanted him to deny
it. For he would deny it? She wondered if he were
angry, but she could not look at him.</p>

<p>The minutes, dragging like weighted hours, told her
that he was not going to answer her. It came to her
then that she would never know whether Gerty’s story
were wholly false, or partly true. She knew, then, that
no wheedling, wife’s or sweetheart’s, would tease that
story from him. It did not belong to him.</p>

<p>His silence frightened her into articulateness. He
must not think that she was foolish! It was not that,
in itself, she meant. The words jostled one another in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
their soft swift rush. He—he had made a mistake once
before. He had liked the sort of woman he had thought
Gerty was. She herself was not like the real Gerty any
more than she was like the other, the woman that did
not exist. He would find that they did not think alike,
believe alike, that there were differences—</p>

<p>“Aren’t you making something out of nothing, Innes?”</p>

<p>That voice could always chide her into silence! Her
speech lay cluttered in ruins, her words like useless
broken bricks falling from the wall she was building.</p>

<p>He took her hand and led her to a pile of rock the
river had not eaten. He pulled her down beside him.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true, with us?”</p>

<p>“It is, with me,” breathed Innes. Their voices were
low as though they were in church.</p>

<p>“And you think it isn’t, with me!” Rickard stood before
her. “Is it because I trust you, I wonder? That I,
loving you, love to have the others love you, too? Don’t
you suppose I know how it is with the rest, MacLean;
how it was with Estrada? Should I be jealous? Why,
I’m not. I’m proud! Isn’t that because I <i>know</i> you,
know the fine steady heart of you? You hated me at
first—and I am proud of that. I don’t love you enough?”
He knelt at her feet, not listening to her pleading. He
bent down and kissed one foot; then the other. “I love
them!” The face he raised to her Innes had never seen
before. He pressed a kiss against her knee. “That, too!
It’s mine. I’ve not said my prayers since I was a boy.
I shall say them again, here, you teaching me.” His
kisses ran up her arm, from the tips of her limp fingers.
His mouth, close to hers, stopped there. He whispered:</p>

<p>“You—kiss me, my girl!”</p>

<p>Slowly, unseeingly, as though drawn by an external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
will, her face raised to his; slowly, their lips met. His
arms were around her; the world was blotted out.</p>

<p>Innes, minutes later, put her mouth against his ear.
It was the Innes he did not know, that he had seen with
others, mischievous, whimsical, romping as a young boy
with MacLean on the <i>Delta</i>.</p>

<p>“I love—red,” she whispered. “And heat and sunshine.
But I love blue, on you; and cold, if it were with
you,—and the rest of the differences—”</p>

<p>He caught her to him. “There are not going to be any
differences!”</p>
